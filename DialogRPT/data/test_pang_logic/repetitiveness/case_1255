Preordered Battlefield 4 and don't have Battlefield 3. Please give this code a good home.
I also have one, wich I don't need: 48SY-S9LP-CJWB-4R5H
Tried to take it, but was already taken. Thanks for your kindness though :)
Got one for ya 22U5 - sgub - 83uk - sqyz
I would take it RIGHT NOW, because it's was only posted a minute ago, but I'm not gonna be a dick. Enjoy it, Sayobal. :)
I'd say in an hour its fair game.....I mean, who stays off of reddit for a whole hour? AMIRITE????
