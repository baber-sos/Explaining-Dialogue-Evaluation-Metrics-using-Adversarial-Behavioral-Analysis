Has anyone else gotten to the point they care more about their team not being jerks then winning?. like the title says. edit: than*
I am at this point and last few games it happened, nice people. It was a nice change of pace.
Everyone in solo queue who ever stops playing to type constantly and dies. I hate this so much. People need to relax.
Earlier I told someone to stop complaining and blaming everyone but himself....then another person started raging his face off........it made my brain hurt.
