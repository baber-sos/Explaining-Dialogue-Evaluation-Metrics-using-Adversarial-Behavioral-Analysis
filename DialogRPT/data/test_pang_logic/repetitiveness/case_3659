UTSC Orientation. Can anyone share their experience of it? Also, what day is the parade (it's downtown right?) and will UTSG &amp; UTM be there too? Thanks
Personally, I hated frosh and stopped going. Forced ice breakers, games, cheers, other random school spirit crap Not my cup of tea. At all.
I was afraid of that. Not mine either :/
