There’s a country that will pay $300,000 per rhino horn to cure cancer and hangovers, and it’s wiping out rhinos.
Mass produce counterfeit rhino horn and flood the market. Why don't billionaires ever do useful shit like that with their loot?
Their horns are made of keratin, that's pretty easy to produce. I'd sell my fingernail clippings for $300,000
What if we blend up a bunch of fingernails, then mold them into a horn shape and laugh our way to the bank? It'll be just like King Rat...
There is no known solvent to liquefy keratin, and then repolymerize it into horn
