What was your favourite game to play as a kid?. Can be anything from video games to school yard games to sports
Video games: Goldeneye. School Yard: Catch the Girl

It's literally just boys chasing girls around the school yard because we didnt like girls yet.
And the ones who were bad at the game ended up being gay later on in life?
