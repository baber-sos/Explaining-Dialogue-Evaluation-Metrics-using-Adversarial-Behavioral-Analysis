National Review outraged that Obama called Holocaust'senseless violence'.
Seriously? They're going to defend Nazi's to make the president look bad? New low.
Wait I'm confused, I thought Obama was a Nazi according to Glenn and Rush, so how can he be against them?
Have they really reached that point of insanity where they can, with a straight face, call someone a facist and a communist in the same sentence?
Nazi stands for National **Socialist** Party. They've been having field day with that for years.
