Alphabets of Europe (xpost /r/linguistics).
It's weird that it seems so comprehensive, yet doesn't even mention letters like Æ, Ø, Å .
I think it tries to include only "main" characters, but it is still unclear why it mentions e.g . both cyrillic Ш/Щ, Ь/Ъ, but not Ukrainian Ї and Ґ .
The Polish' Ł' is also omitted from the picture . (BTW, Poles, how do you get an uppercase' ż' on your keyboards, if I press shift+ż i get ń)
