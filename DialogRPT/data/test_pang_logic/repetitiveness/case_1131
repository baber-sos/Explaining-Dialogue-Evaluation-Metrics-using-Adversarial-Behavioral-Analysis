Just showing some love to an underrated state. Glacier National Park, Montana..
I don't think Montana is underrated by anyone.
I dunno. Rotten Tomatoes currently gives it a 78%, and Pitchfork gave it a scathing 5.6 when it first came out.
Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 44% actually. The full name is 'Hannah Montana: The Movie'.
