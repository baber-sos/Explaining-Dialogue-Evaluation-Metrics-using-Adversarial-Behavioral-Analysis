This is a 69-year-old trucker who has been on the road for 28 years. The left side of his face is damaged and has thickened because of UVA radiation..
Finally a legitimate reason for me to wear a hockey mask while driving! All that's left is to find a medical justification for the machete.
Not really. This guy probably had horrible nutrition as well.
That in no way explains why the damage is so prominent on only one side of his face. Clearly it is sun damage.
Maybe he wasnt chewing his nutritious food on that side of his face. That's why I spread my 90% chewed grub all over my mouth before swallowing.
