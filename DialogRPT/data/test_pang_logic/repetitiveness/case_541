The "If ______ happens, I will eat _______" thread.. If Saint Louis beats Louisville in this tournament I will eat my 2005 final four t-shirt. Commit, people.
If Ole Miss wins against Wisconsin tomorrow, I will end every post in r/CollegeBasketball with something nice to say about Marshall Henderson until the end of the tournament.
Fuck ole miss, fuck marshall henderson, fuck my bracket, fuck Wisconsin not being able to make a shot, fuck the tournament. Marshall henderson has nice hair.
