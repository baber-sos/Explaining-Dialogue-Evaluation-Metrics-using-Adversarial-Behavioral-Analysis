Date Night. I want to take my girlfriend out for a fun date night. Does anyone know of any good restaurants?
There are a couple of nice places in the Heights. Seven, Jim's Bistro, French Toast. Also, 309 in junction city. All a bit pricey but good food and atmosphere.
Also Publik House - try the Bacon and Blue Fries mmmmmm. (URL)
