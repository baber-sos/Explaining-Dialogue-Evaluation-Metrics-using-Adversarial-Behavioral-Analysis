USC upsets (4) Stanford after last minute field goal .
USC's defense played incredibly in the fourth quarter . Related: omg Kevin Hogan is [awful] (URL)
He's not awful, he's just not Andrew Luck . If you want awful just search for Kevin Craft's junior year stats .
Fine, today he was awful . Both interceptions were completely on him, I dunno what's gotten into him .
The second one was off a tip from a recover who was shoved out of bounds
