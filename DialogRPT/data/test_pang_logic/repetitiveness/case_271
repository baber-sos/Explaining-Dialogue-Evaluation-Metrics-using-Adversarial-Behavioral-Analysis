Simple Question Wednesday. Happy Hump Day!
I just oredered the [Hourglass Ambient Lighting Palette] (URL) which looks GORGEOUS. Anyone have experience with Ambient Lighting and can give a review or tips on how/where to apply?
I have mood light and i set my foundation with it. I use a fluffy brush. It definitely softens things up. I like it a lot!
