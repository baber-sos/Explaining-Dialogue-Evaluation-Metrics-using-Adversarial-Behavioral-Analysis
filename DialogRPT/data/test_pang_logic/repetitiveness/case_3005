Buford Highway Farmers Market - sushi made fresh all day, 16pc assortment for $9.99!.
Wow those are some fantastic deals!
And right next to the sushi counter is a dumpling counter with fresh Korean dumplings that are to die for. Enough to fill up a fatty like me for $5.99
have you had the empanadas over in the cafe area? they are freaking delicious.
