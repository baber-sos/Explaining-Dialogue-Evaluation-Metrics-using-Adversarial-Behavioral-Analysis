TIL the world may run out of chocolate by 2020 .
What will become of Halloween? Easter? No chocolate Santa's??? I for one am eating every ounce I can get my hands on for the next seven years .
Halloween: Kids get ziploc bags full of Candy Corn Christmas: Advent Calenders with gumdrops in them Easter: Jelly Beans inside of eggs . What a terrible thing to imagine.
