Justice League War trailer (IGN).
Feels like they are missing someone i'm just not use to seeing either Aquaman or J'onn
Martian Manhunter wasn't in this series. Not saying that's a good thing, but just so you know.
Yeah i know but in my eyes the JL isn't the same if it's missing both Aquaman and J'onn, either one needs to fill the gap for me :P
