TIL A 47 year old Indian man started planting trees when he was 16 and now lives in his own jungle with tigers, elephants and other wild animals .
there was a guy in ohio last year that lived with lions . he let them out and they caused all kinds of trouble .
I don't remember them causing trouble, they climbed into trees and stuff, then people killed them.
