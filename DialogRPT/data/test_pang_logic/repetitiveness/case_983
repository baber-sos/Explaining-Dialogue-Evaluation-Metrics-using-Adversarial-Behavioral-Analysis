I told my 94yr old Gma all the nice things you said about her and her quilt, so she wanted me to share her latest finished project. :-).
Granny does some nice work
Thank you. I agree. It's not everyone's cup of tea though. she calls it, "old okie craftin." :-)
I love ''old okie craftin.'' Tell your nan it's a wonderful quilt, and you should be lucky to have such a sweet looking grandmom.
I am very lucky. She's my only living grandparent so she's even extra special.
Get her to do an AMA. I wanna hear the stories she can tell.
Her stories are incredible. she's seen a lot in 94 years.
OP, please do an AMA (: I really wanna know what she can tell. 94 years ago was a completely different time.
