[50/50] Pistol mass suicide (NSFL) | Pistol robbery detained in the most awesome way (NSFW).
Source: V/H/S 2, a great horror movie . This section of the movie is a mindfuck in particular .
Directed by the man behind the Raid: Redemption, one of the most visceral and intense action films I've ever seen .
Sadly that's all R: R was . I really liked the movie, but it was just so action packed and visceral that it made little sense to me.
