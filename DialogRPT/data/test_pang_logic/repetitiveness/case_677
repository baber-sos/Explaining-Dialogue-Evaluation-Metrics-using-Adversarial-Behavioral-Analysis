secondary fermenter?. How often is this really needed? What kind of beer recipes usually require it? I haven't found any "standard" recipes that need it.
Most beers don't ever need a secondary, and it's good practice to handle the beer as little as possible.
yea i dunno why someone would buy a starter kit with one than.
