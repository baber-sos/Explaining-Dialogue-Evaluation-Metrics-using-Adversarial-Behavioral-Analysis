Took my 3 yo down the street to watch some construction; he wanted to wear his old halloween costume..
This is why I want kids. But then again I really don't want kids.
Totally worth it :) as long as you don't mind blood, vomit, and poop, and occasionally feeling like a total failure over the smallest things lol.
Sounds a lot like college.
Sounds like sex
Especially the part about smallest things...
