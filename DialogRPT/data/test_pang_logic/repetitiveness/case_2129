Daughter brought me a snack she made ALL BY HERSELF.
Eat them all or she'll think you don't love her and become a stripper.

Some of the truest words ever spoken: "They don't grade fathers, but if your daughter is a stripper, you fucked up"
I don't see what's wrong with being a stripper. If this were a male stripper in question, nobody would bat an eyelash. Even people with well-adjusted childhoods like money.
I judge male strippers just as much as female ones
