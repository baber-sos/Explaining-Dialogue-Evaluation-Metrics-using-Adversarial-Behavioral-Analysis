The two sides of India..
So you're telling me that India has both poor and rich people AT THE SAME TIME!?!?
That's interesting; I thought the picture was commentary on the stigma of skin colour in India. [Here's an interesting article on it from the Guardian.] (URL)
I thought it was about how some people like to wear more modern, westernized clothing and others prefer traditional clothing.
I thought it was about how their caste system just completely fucks over certain people right from the day they're born.
only in small rural villages. 99% of people dont give a fuck about the caste system.
Also 98.6% of statistics are pulled out from asses.
