I told my 94yr old Gma all the nice things you said about her and her quilt, so she wanted me to share her latest finished project .: -).
Granny does some nice work
Thank you . I agree . It's not everyone's cup of tea though . she calls it, "old okie craftin .": -)
I love "old okie craftin ." Tell your nan it's a wonderful quilt, and you should be lucky to have such a sweet looking grandmom .
I am very lucky . She's my only living grandparent so she's even extra special .
Get her to do an AMA . I wannahear the stories she can tell.
