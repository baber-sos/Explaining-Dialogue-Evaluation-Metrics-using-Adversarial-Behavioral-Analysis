TIL A 47 year old Indian man started planting trees when he was 16 and now lives in his own jungle with tigers, elephants and other wild animals.
there was a guy in ohio last year that lived with lions. he let them out and they caused all kinds of trouble.
I don't remember them causing trouble, they climbed into trees and stuff, then people killed them.
It was a lot of trouble to murder all those lions.
You ever skin a lion to make your kids a play rug? Not easy at all. Blood gets everywhere. Inconvenient is what it is!
