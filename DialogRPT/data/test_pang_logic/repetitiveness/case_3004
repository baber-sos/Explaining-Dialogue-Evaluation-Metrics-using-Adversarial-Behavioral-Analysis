Buford Highway Farmers Market - sushi made fresh all day, 16pc assortment for $9.99! .
Wow those are some fantastic deals!
And right next to the sushi counter is a dumpling counter with fresh Korean dumplings that are to die for . Enough to fill up a fatty like me for $5.99
have you had the empanadas over in the cafe area? they are freaking delicious .
I have not . I don't get to go very often as I live a couple hours away . I will make it a point to try them the next time.
