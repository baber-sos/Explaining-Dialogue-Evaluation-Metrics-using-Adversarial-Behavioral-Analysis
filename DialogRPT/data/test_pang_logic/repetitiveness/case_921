I hate admins sometimes.
thats an interesting way to crop
what did i do? can't see it..
It's just one long line, like a website banner.
well i wanted to show the game disconnect message not my whole battlelog page.. if you meant why the picture is in 1680x1050 it's because i'm bad at editing
Search for "Snipping Tool" in windows. It lets you crop something on your screen and save.
