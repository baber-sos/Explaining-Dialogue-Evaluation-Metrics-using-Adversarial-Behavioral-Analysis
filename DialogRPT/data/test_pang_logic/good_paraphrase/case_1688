"Rent me a gun, Shin?" The boy smiled. "Two hour.".
It's from the book Neuromancer by William Gibson. Awesome book.
just began reading it for the first time, I am only at chapter 4 but so far I really like it!
Read it at least two times, you will notice so many details every time you read it again.
