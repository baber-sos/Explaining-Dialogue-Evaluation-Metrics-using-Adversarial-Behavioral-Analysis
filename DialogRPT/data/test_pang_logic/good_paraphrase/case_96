Obamacare Is Already Forcing Private Insurers To Lower Their Premiums.
I pay from my family's health care over $15,000 per year and it has gone up every year for the past five years.....don't believe political rhetoric.
Thankfully even some people on the left are beginning to see what a joke Obamacare is. It has some good things, but it is a massive failure already.
