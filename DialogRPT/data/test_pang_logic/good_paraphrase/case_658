MRW I give birth to a tennis ball sized clot while on my period..
Guy here. Is this really a thing?
Girl here, not really sure. I mean yeah, we get clots, but I think tennis ball sized ones are... different.
I get large clots, usually about the size of a mandarin orange during my cycle.

For the first few weeks of my cycle I get large clots, usually about the size of a mandarin orange.
