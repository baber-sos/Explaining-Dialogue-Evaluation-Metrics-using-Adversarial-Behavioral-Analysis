I can't tell if this is from Bleach or Full Metal Alchemest. Or neither. Or both.
It's from Full Metal Alchemist.
Huh. That's what I was leaning towards.
Yeah she's introduced pretty late into both of the series (FMA and FMA Brotherhood) and she is Ed and Al's teacher of alchemy.
Oh, so that's why I didn't realize.
Have you not finished watching it? (Brotherhood is best, avoid original animated series)
