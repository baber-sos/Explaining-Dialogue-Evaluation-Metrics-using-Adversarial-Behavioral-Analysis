Hack the system!.
When I worked at burger king, we would mix the strawberry cheesecake in the milkshake stirrer. Best milkshakes ever, the best perk of being an employee there.
My buddy worked at Little Caesars and would make calzones using crazy bread dough. They were crazy delicious!
Lo-Cal Calzone Zone.
Pizza? Never heard of it.
