Bo Jackson was a Ninja - old Royals gif (xPost r/kansascity).
I've seen this GIF a million times, but never with the batter included. I now mildly hate Bo Jackson for stealing a double from ~~Ripken~~ Orsulak.
Or Joe Orsulak.
Is that who that is? I could swear he's wearing an 8, but it's kind of hard to tell for sure.
