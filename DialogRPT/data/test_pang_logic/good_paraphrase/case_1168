Never let any one tell you that an image cant get some one to question their beliefs. Here is the image that made me question them and become atheist..
Hey OP, I'm happy to hear that :) I was the one that created this little comic strip (using my daughter's toys!). Keep on questioning...
Hey there. I've always loved this image. It's thought provoking, powerful, and I have a sweet spot for cute bunnies. Here's some gold. Thank you.
