World's fastest brain transplant. [Surgeon Simulator 2013].
Correct me if i'm wrong, but that doesn't look like the proper procedure when it comes to a brain transplant. But what do i know, i'm no surgeon.
No need to physically connect the brain. Just gotta make sure it's there.
I think that as the healing process occurs, the pathways between the body and the brain naturally reattach themselves.
