Good Guy England Government as an american with no health insurance I am truly thankful.
British government, not "England government". Also pounds instead of dollars. How could you get so much wrong in such a short space?
Or maybe he paid about six quid and converted it back for the American audience he was writing the meme for?
Judging by the other mistakes made in the post I highly doubt he is capable of converting the value of currency.
