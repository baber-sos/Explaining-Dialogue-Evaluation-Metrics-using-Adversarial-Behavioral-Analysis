Eaves out, Nyquist Recalled.
It's a shame to see Eaves sit. He gives so much every game. Him and Tootoo on a line would build some great energy.
With Helm, that'd be a fear inducing line.
The speed alone would be amazing. Plus Tootoo and Helms hitting and Eaves offensive perks. It's a shame Cleary is taking a 3rd line role.
We'll see what Babs does when Helm returns. He seems pretty excited about it.
