What's the problem? There's a guy holding the ladder.
But the ladder isn't even touching the ground. He's actually holding it to get that bit extra height.
I'm pretty sure the first rung is just in the bush around his feet.
I hope you're right.
That would be extremely heavy.
I would be REALLY impressed if that guy was actually holding it up...

This is not really physics. It's more logic than anything else.
nope, it's physics. just look at the angle.
