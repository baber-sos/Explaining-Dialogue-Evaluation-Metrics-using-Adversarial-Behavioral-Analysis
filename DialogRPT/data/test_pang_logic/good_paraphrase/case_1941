What's one possession you have that's completely unique to you, that no one else in the world could possibly have?.
Silver chain necklace that my girlfriend hand made for me before she passed away.
Picture? Sounds interesting!
You can't just go around asking people pictures of their deceased girlfriends
Ah the old reddit deceaseroo!
Someone! Someone continue the chain! I'm on mobile and cant make the link!
Ah, [the old Reddit Switcharoo!] (URL)
