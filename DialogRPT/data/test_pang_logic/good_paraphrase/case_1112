Now THAT'S faith. That building is a church....
I never thought this would be so relevant (URL)
What's the problem? There's a guy holding the ladder.
But the ladder isn't even touching the ground. He's actually holding it to get that bit extra height.
I'm pretty sure the first rung is just in the bush around his feet.
I hope you're right.
That would be extremely heavy.
