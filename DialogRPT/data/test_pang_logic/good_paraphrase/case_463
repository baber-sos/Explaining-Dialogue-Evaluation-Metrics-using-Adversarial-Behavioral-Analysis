The RIM (blackberry) network has gone down in the UK. Again.. Across all networks it seems. Currently testing with t-mobile, O2 and orange. Seems to have affected most people.
confirmed to be global, eta 3h from now
Do you have any links (media or otherwise) with details or confirmation of the outage?
