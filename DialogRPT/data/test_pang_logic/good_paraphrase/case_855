Then you find out they are racists....
Yeah, but so is every race. And also, the imperials are stopping all worship of Talos, so I justify joining the storm cloaks by fighting for freedom of religion
Are Khajit and Argonians really racist though? We dont really get a glimpse into their society but the ones we see dont seem to have a problem with other races.
