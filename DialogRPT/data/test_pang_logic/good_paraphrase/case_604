In honour of no-shave-november, which trend do you really hate/find pointless?.
Taking pictures of your food to post it on your social media. It's pointless, the million hashtags make it annoying.
I agree with this of all my heart. I find it weird that people spend more time taking pictures of food, than enjoying it.
