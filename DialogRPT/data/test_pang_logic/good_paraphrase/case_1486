New photo of Boston bombing suspect #2 IN the hospital xpost from /r/pics.
where is that neck wound from?
One report I read said he got shot through the mouth and the exit wound was on his neck. That giant scar is probably from the surgery.
Who shoots downward through the mouth?
Maybe he was crouched? Lying prone? Kneeling? Crazy shit happens during manhunts and gun fights...
