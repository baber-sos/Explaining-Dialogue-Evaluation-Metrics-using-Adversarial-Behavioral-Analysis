Charles Ramsey deserves Free Big Macs for life. Who agrees?.
Mc Donalds replied on Twitter. @McDonaldsCorp: We salute the courage of Ohio kidnap victims &amp; respect their privacy. Way to go Charles Ramsey- we'll be in touch.
I swear I wanted a Big mac after watching his interview.
I actually did get one for lunch but only because everyone was talking about this guy...
I've never eaten one and I want one :(
