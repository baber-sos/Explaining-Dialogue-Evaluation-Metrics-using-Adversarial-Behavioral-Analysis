Premier League Team population size.
The thing with Norwich is that their catchment area is essentially all of East Anglia. While the city itself may be small, Norwich are popular in the entire region.
Apart from in Ipswich of course.
It's really just Norfolk. People from Suffolk don't tend to support Norwich.
You're right, my bad for generalising East Anglia as Norfolk.
