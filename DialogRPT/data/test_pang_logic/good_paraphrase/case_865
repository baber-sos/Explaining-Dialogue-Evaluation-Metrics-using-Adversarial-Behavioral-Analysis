A piece so hard that the composer had a hard time playing it. Franz Liszt's Rondo Fantastique "El Contrabandista", played by Valentina Lisitsa.
To memorize and play a piece this difficult without errors...it seems so impossible. The level of skill here is unbelievable
Boundlessly amazing, but it was not all done in one take.
