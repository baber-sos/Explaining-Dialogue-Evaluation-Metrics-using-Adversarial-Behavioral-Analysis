(Spoilers all) Leaked S4 photos of the filming of the PW.
..are we sure this is the Purple Wedding? Very strange it's going on outdoors during the day. I find it hard to believe they'd change the setting that much.
Seconding this thought. Outdoors in daylight doesn't seem right. Just being outdoors, period, seems kinda off. Unless I'm remembering it all wrong...
You aren't, the feast takes place in the throne room.
Man, I always imagined it was in some big open garden with like, bushes and midgets and shit.
