How are you cheating the system?. What have you been getting away with?
I don't have towel service, but when I go to the gym I just ask for a towel anyway. They never check and always give me a towel.
Your gym charges for towels? They're free at every gym I've been to
Your gym gives you towels? We have to take our own.
