Realistic or not, what is your wish list for the next iPhone?. Thanks for the responses!
EXTREMELY long battery life. I'm talking 3-4 days without charging type of battery life, without noticeable added bulk or weight. And a fingerprint sensor sounds pretty neat too.
I wouldn't mind an iPhone that weighed a pound if it meant a couple of days of battery life.
