Which sitcom, from any era, had a "serious" episode that particularly stood out to you? Describe it..
Lizzy McGuire had an episode where Miranda had an eating disorder. I don't totally remember what happened, but I remember being so glad Miranda had friends like Lizzy and Gordo.
I relly dug that show. Gordo was the man. i actually no lie just watched teh Lizzy McGuire Movie last night.
