(Spoilers All) GRRM confirms that Strong Belwas won't be part of the TV series.
Honestly, it makes sense. He doesn't add anything to the plot that can't go to somebody else. One less person to have to cram in. Shame though, he's kindof awesome.
*kind of* awesome? the man was a hero! I'll sorely miss the visualization of his defecating in the direction of Meereen
Now we gotta settle with Jorah or Barristan pooping on a corpse... Actually, if that happens, I'm okay with Strong Belwas not being in it.
