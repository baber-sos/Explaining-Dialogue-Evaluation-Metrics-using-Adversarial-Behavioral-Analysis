Torchic Distribution?. Can some please explain how this [Torchic Distribution] (URL) work?? I haven't played Pokémon since Ruby, so bare with me.
Will I be able to say, keep trying until I get an adamant torchic or something?
I'm 90% sure that's not possible, usually the event Pokémon have predetermined movesets and stats.
