Ariel Castro, convicted Cleveland kidnapper, found dead in cell..
Looks like he didn't like being held in a cell.
It looks like he overdosed on the taste of his own medicine.
I feel like this comment needs the CSI "YEAAAAAAAAAAH" button. But I'm not sure why...
When does he take the sunglasses off? After "taste" or "overdosed"?
Neither. He puts them on. C'mon man, you call yourself a redditor, you should know this! Yeaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh (Puts sunglasses ON)
