"They are not going to call themselves the Cobb Crackers or the Smyrna Assholes" - Hans Utz, Atlanta Deputy COO.
The fact is, his comments represent how a lot of us feel so I don't think it'll negatively affect his political standing.
Maybe so, in the sense of Atlantans talking down about suburbs, but the bottom line is the word cracker has an extremely negative connotation/is racist.
If Atlanta's pre Braves minor league team was the Atlanta Crackers, how racist could it be?
Pretty racist
