My custom 15" beast is finally done. Hadwin Audio "Kill 'Em All" sub. (more info in comments).
What kind of enclosure are you planning and in what vehicle?
I'm building a box for it on Saturday. My plan is ~5.5 ft^3 with a big ass port tuned to 34Hz. I have a 2008 Grand Prix.
5.5 cubes for a 12?? My 18 was in 6!
