Seriously overlooked stash spot. [Fixed].
Dammit, Washington legalized too! I'm sick of Colorado getting all the credit!!
CO resident, sorry! My brother lives in Washington though, and he assures me that Colorado's new law is superior to Washington's.
Why's that?
Colorado now allows for personal growth of 6 plants, without requiring any type of additional state regulated licensure. I502 on the other hand, does not at this time.
So I was gonna go to Med School in Washington but now it looks like I'm gonna have to move to Colorado. Ain't that a bitch?
