How my sister and her fiancé broke the news to our parents.
That's pretty gross.
Why is it gross? I wouldn't say it's aww, but it's not "gross."
Because it immediately makes you think of them having sex, rather than just announcing the pregnancy. Really weird thing to give to your parents.
Pssst....that's how babies are made. It's not weird. E: I guess some people find sex icky... Kinda sad.
