What movie have you watched the most times that never fails to entertain each time you watch it?.
Pulp Fiction. Great dialogue, I always have a laugh, and I pick up on something new each time.
That's one of my favorite things about Tarantino movies. There's so many nuances to pick up on, the movie always has something new to offer.
