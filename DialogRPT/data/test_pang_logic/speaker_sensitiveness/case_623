Photographed a wedding a few weeks ago and found this pic of a guest holding a... whiskey syringe?.
Thanks guys! Never seen an e-cigarette like that before, but when I do they are usually covered in dust at the 7/11.
Yeah, the 7/11 ones are pretty terrible. The style you photographed are excellent. The only way I was able to quit smoking.
