For those of us that didn't watch MLG Dallas, what are some of the tricks that you picked up?.
Raid on hardpoint when you first spawn on the garage break the glass and jump off the edge.
This was patched but i think you can still team kill (if in custom not pubs) and get a closer spawn to the hard point.
