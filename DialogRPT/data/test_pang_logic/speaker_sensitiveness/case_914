Dempster suspended five games for throwing at A-Rod..
Dempster should receive a bonus, a medal, and a parade. Those who cheat at baseball ought to be plunked regularly.
So Hank Aaron should have been plunked regularly?
How'd he cheat?
He used amphetamines. Same with Willie Mays and Mike Schmidt.
They weren't illegal when Aaron or Mays played.
