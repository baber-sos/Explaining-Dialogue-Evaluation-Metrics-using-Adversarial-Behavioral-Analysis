What novels have "the gods" as actual characters?. If you have one, post it. If possible, add a comment about the book's quality.
Try the Iron Druid chronicles by Kevin Hearne. Really funny books. It is like the Dresden files but a bit less serious.
Also, if you haven't listened to the audiobooks, you should check them out if you can. IMO they're really well done. (even if you've already read the books)
