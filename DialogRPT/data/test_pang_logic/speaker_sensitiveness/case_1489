The best thing about Battlefront 2 was that you could play as a Wampa..
If i buy this off steam, is the online good and active?
YES it is, and it's on sale from may 3rd to may 6th for 66% off, as well as all Star Wars games.
Well I just bought it and apparently Steam is still selling it even though there are no cd keys left.
