What is your all-time favorite game?.
Game dev story. So addicting
here's an unpopular opinion. I think game dev story is retarded
How so?
I think i don't like it because its pixel-y. I hate pixel games.
Seriously? That's your reason? It doesn't have to have fancy-ass graphics to be a good game. I have a solid 15 hours put into GDS...
