GameBoy Advanced Emulator without Jailbreak in 1 minute.
Can I download on a 4?
Yes
When I tried installing, it says it could not be downloaded at this time. Any suggestions?
Had the same thing a few minutes ago. Just retry until it works. I'm playing Pokemon as we speak.
Are you using the one from github.com? Cuz I've been retrying for the past hour..
