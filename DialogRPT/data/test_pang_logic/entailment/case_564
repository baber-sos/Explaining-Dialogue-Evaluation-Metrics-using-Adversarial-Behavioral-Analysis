I just want to know what it would feel like..
Nothing better than some classic Socom.
I wish more games were like socom used to be, it had an almost perfect recipe for an online game, and the user base on the whole was great.
It was a great game but for a noob who started playing late, the community wasn't very welcoming
Which game did you start with? Socom 2 had the best community imo, socom 3 as second. Lots of clans and clan matches.
Everybody in socom 2 wall glitched on that desert city map though.

Frostfire was the same. Always catching people, on both sides, that failed to move immediately after the match started.
