TIL Stallone was paid $12 million to star in Over The Top--the film grossed about $16 million total..
the music was done by Giorgio Moroder? Somehow I guess I should've heard that name before Daft Punk's song about him.
He also did the music for Scarface and pretty much Donna Summer's entire career.

I am curious as to why this is a gif.
