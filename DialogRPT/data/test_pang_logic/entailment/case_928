Hey, look what happens if you type in "Gay" into google!.
Also lesbian, transgender, transsexual, bisexual, and other lgbt related terms :D
Though not genderqueer. :(
Not for agender, asexual, or pansexual either.

Doesn't work for sapiosexual either. Can't blame them for not having the more obscure words though.
