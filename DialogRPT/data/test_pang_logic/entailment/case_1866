Looks more like a jumping spider to me by size. There are tons of species in that family however, so it's tough to narrow it down. Are you in Australia?

If I could see its eyes better I could verify a jumping spider (there are over 5000 species of jumpers however). Did it jump? That's a pretty good indication.
