mikael's doesnt give assist. yeah, title kinda says all, the heal doesnt give you an assist
I don't think the Shard of True Ice active gives assists, either.
On that note, if you don't damage anyone with Taric ult, you don't either.
To be fair, auras never give assists. It's like complaining Janna's passive doesn't give assists on everything.

The latest one is "wait, what?" It is in commercials and tv shows and so annoying.
