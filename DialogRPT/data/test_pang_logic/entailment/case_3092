Pizza.gg is a scam, I selected iNcontrol but a random dude delivered the pizza. he did not even wear an eg shirt wtf
If you order through pizza.QQ, Idra will deliver your pizza, tell you that you're bad, and then leave before you can even pay him.
You Forgot the complaining about too much cheese
Apologise for picking that topping...
