[HELP] WidgetLocker: how do I get rid of this black bar?.
You have an HTC I'm sure (on phone, can't see flair) and this is the "menu" button that they removed after 4.2. Which model do you have?

What's with the black borders top and bottom? Looks like you snapped a screenshot of it on a phone without orienting the phone properly.
