I'm using Safari on Mountain Lion MBPr and this kinda stuff happens all the time. Anyone know a fix?.
There is no fix or workaround, it's a graphic driver issue. Apple knows about it and will push out an update when it's ready.

It's where Canberra should have been, it would have given us another coastal city to take the strain of Syd., Mel, &amp; Bris.
