Bryzgalov signs with Edmonton.
Why is everyone making fun of Oil for doing this? Look at Flyers without Bryz... LOOK AT IT!
What about the flyers without bryz? The fact that they have competent goaltending?
uh...
.925 SV% and 2.37 GAA. Mason has been much more than just competent.
get out of here with your statistics and logic. let the woefully uninformed "hockey fans" on this subreddit continue downvoting me because awwww poor bryzgalov LOL PHILLY GOALTENDING LOLOL
Logic also tells me the Flyers without Bryz still suck.
Yes they do, congratulations. They still suck despite competent goaltending, which they did not have when bryz was here. Anything else?
