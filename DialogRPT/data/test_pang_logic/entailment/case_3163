U.S. chess prodigy, Bobby Fisher, playing 50 opponents simultaneously at his Hollywood hotel on 12 April 1964. He won 47, lost 1 and drew 2. [1025x736].
I'm really interested in knowing how much that one lost must have bothered him.
I'm also interested in knowing a bit about the person he lost to. And if he somehow got lucky, or was some kind of brilliant chess player himself.
