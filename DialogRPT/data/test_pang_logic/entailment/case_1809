DAFT PUNK's new album Random Access Memories.
Buying this album in MP3 would be the biggest mistake you've made all year
Not all of us have the means to play vinyls.
If you are a fan of electronic music, you would be wise to not listen to any of it via MP3....
What would the CD be in?.mp3? Where would the common bloke who hasn't a clue get the best quality? I like electronic, but haven't the faintest idea.
Flac is a direct rip of CD but most people don't use flac players so you want to find wav or aiff
Seeing as how WMP can play.flac... I don't know about that.
