Wow, gold iPhones are going for over $1,000 on eBay right now..
Makes me wish I would have waited in line, used my upgrade then flipped it for a few hundred dollars.
did this when iphone 5 came out. bought it for $200 then sold it same day for $600.
You didn't actually make any money. You end up paying for the whole phone, possibly more, over the course of that two year contract.
Not necessarily in the US, where most plans are the same cost regardless of your upgrade status or phone subsidy.
So he kept the SIM which required constant payments, right? And what did he use as his normal phone? Not an american.
Probably the current phone he had before the upgrade that he sold.
