Just found out!. We found out this weekend that we're expecting! This is my first visit here. Is there some kind of orientation or handbook or something? :)
Congratulations! Do you know how far along you are?
I haven't seen a doctor yet, but according to the internet I'm at 5 weeks! My due date (again, according to the internet) is 2/7/14. I love that date!
