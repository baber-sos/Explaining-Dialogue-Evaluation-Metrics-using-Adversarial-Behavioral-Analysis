TALON 1V5 PENTA KILL. I was the only one on my team doing well, and only had a few kills over their adc. (URL)
I know penta kills are abit overrated and such. But damn, Penta kill in 1 shot. Look cool :P
Two shots, he used his ult, then finished them off with his W, but still this is amazing!
He used Hydra too.
Aaah didn't see that, but we can't deny that this is a good penta.
He also used his boots, and whatever other items he had bought. Also I'm willing to bet that he used a mouse and a keyboard.
Don't forget his internet provider and his mom for making him breakfast that morning.
My mom didn't make me any breakfast that morning :( but I did eat a bowl of wheaties.
