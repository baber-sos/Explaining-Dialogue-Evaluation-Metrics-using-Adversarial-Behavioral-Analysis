What minor thing in movies and shows almost always breaks your immersion?.
When characters don't speak realistically. I'm talking about flawless execution--no stutters, breaks, fillers, sentence fragments, etc. No one talks that perfectly.

Marley and Me! Jesus, I watched that movie not too long after my own dog died and I was just gutted by it. There was nothing manly about my tears.
