What's the greatest rivalry with your team that only exists in the other team's mind? [x-post from /r/nfl]. Does Oregon vs. the SEC count?
Colorado-Nebraska. Bill McCartney randomly declared us their primary rival in 1982 (I think) to try to motivate his terrible teams. Nebraska is 21-7-1 against the Buffs since then.

That is very well done. Do you mind sharing info on how you did it? Camera, tripod, dolly, etc.?
