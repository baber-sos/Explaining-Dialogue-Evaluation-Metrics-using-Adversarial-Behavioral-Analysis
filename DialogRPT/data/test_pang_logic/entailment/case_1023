I've shown you my drums before, and i think it's time to show you my entire recording studio. Hope you like it. (x-post from r/wearethemusicmakers).
Great setup. Why did you go with the Sm58's on the toms as opposed to 57's?
Thanks! I'm trying to find some used MD421's or similar, but till then, the microphones i use live for singing will have to do.
