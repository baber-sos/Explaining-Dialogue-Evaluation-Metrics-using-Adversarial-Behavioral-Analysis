TIL Matthew Broderick (who played Ferris Bueller and voiced Simba) killed two people and only paid a fine of $175.
Another rich kid that almost had to deal with consequence.
It was an accident.
He was charged with dangerous driving causing death. That's much more than an accident.
Which was changed to careless driving. I'm fairly confident he did not intend to hurt or kill anybody with his vehicle.
Intent is not relevant when your careless actions result in the death of two people.

You are wrong, because we're not talking about murder vs. manslaughter. He was charged with careless driving, which has no intent component to it.
