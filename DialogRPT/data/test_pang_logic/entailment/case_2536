This restaurant has over 20 different types of burger meat.
This is not wtf.
Really? Cause I said wtf when I saw this... Hence why I uploaded it to /wtf. Or is this not the right place to put something that's wtf?

One mans wtf is another mans mildly interesting. I don't think it's wtf due to have seen and eaten this kind of food before.
