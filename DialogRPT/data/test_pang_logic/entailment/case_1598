What minor thing in movies and shows almost always breaks your immersion?.
When characters don't speak realistically. I'm talking about flawless execution--no stutters, breaks, fillers, sentence fragments, etc. No one talks that perfectly.

Yes, but you have to think... Would you *want* to watch a movie in which people are constantly stuttering?
