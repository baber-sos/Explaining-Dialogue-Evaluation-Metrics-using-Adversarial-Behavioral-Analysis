Recommendations for a cigar on a college student budget?. Looking for a quality/affordable stick to enjoy this weekend's games
Check the wiki for sub 5 smokes but personally I have to go with the Perdomo Champagne 10th Anniversary, its a solid quality smoke that I always enjoy.
I've heard mixed reviews on the Champagne either you love it or you down right hate it
