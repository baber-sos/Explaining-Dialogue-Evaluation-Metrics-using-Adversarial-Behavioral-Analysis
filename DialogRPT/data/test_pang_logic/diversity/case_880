I am going to Comic-Con Denver on the 31st as Captain America . I like seeing other people's DIYs, so here is the build on my shield! .
Are you sure this is allowed at the convention? Denver Comic Con (and most conventions actually) have a rule against metal weapons and props . It's realy cool though!
