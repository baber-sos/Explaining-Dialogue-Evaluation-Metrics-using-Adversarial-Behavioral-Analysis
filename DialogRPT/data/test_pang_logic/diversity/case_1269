Pre-workout and Creatine question .. If your pre-workout has Creatine Monohydrate in it, should you still be taking the 5g of Creatine daily or not?
Yes you should, the creatine in preworkouts is usually less than 2 grams . The recommended dosage for creatine monohydrate is 5-10 grams, so 7 grams is a reasonable amount.
