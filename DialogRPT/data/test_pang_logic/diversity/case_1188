TRASH TALK GOLD: LeBron 'glad' he dunked on Jason Terry .
I'm glad Lebron is proud of dunking over a 35 year old man that is 100 pound lighter and 6-7 inches shorter, that's something worth bragging about
So much butthurt . Why did Terry go up to contest the dunk then? Why didn't he just get out of the way? Fuckin Celtics fans
