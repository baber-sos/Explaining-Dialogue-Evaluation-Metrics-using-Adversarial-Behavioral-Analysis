What film do people misunderstand the meaning of? .
The original ending of I Am Legend has a completely different meaning than the one that is now on the movie .
The [alternate ending] (URL) was a lot better
Still didn't compare to the book's ending and meaning .
Agreed . The book is a favourite of mine . the movie .... well it was enjoyable.
