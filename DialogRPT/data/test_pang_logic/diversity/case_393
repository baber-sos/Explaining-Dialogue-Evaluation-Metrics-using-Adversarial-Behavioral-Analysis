Some how I got on a delta flight with my pocket knife? Da fuq?! .
It's not illegal to bring pocketknives on planes . I do it regularly . There are size requirements for the blades though .
Interesting . The [TSA website] (URL) (which I don't doubt at all is ambiguous and inconsistent) seems to say otherwise . Do you have a current written policy saying it is allowed?
