What are some of the most amazingly accurate predictions about the future ever made? .
The novel, Wreck of the Titan, which basically old the story of the Titanic years before it sank .
More of an amazing coincidence than an accurate prediction, no?
Apparently the adjectives used to describe the Titan were along the same lines as the ones used to describe the Titanic
