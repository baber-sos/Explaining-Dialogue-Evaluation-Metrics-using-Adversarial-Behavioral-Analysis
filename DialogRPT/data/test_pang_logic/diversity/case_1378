why is the ab wheel so amazing? . why is it preferred by so many r/bodyweightfitness users
- it's cheap - it has progressions - it's a nice dynamic movement vs. a static hold, such as an l-sit for plank .
do you find L sits harder? i can do 2 or 3 roll outs and i can only hold an L sit for like 5 seconds on the ground
