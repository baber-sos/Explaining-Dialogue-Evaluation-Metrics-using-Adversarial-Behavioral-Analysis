I hope he has car insurance, because he's going to need a new seat .
If he was Russian [this] (URL) is probably how he reacted .
Yeah, or [like that] (URL)
My god, the deadpan dialogue is hilarious . "Welp, looks like we arrived ." "Yep, looks like we're swimming now ." "So where are we swimming to?" "Looks like to the shore ."
Also: "You can stop using the steering wheel ."
Wait, I feel stupid here, they were speaking Russian, is this just what you imagine they were saying?
