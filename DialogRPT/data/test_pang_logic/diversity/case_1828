Swim anyone? .
Totally Harmless, I use to pick these up as a child and throw them at my little brother
They don't have any stinging parts at all?
Nope . I used to go swimming when there were this many in the water . They do feel absolutely creepy though, and have a tendency to swim up your surf shorts.
