I feel so dirty . (we started at the bottom now we at the top).
No COD will ever come close to World at War or COD 4 in my personal opinion . Those two are what gave COD the popularity it has today .
CoD4 was the only one I maxxed out in MP, so many fun memories . And the Single player for WaW was so amazing to me at the time.
