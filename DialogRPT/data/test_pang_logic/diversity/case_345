While on my way to target I stopped at a Hess express gas station and found a bag near the air pumps . Here are it's contents ..
I don't think I'd be advertising that on Reddit . I'd just quietly stash it in my sock drawer and never say a word .
It's ok . It didn't really happen .
or OP just put a couple of 1 dollar bills into bundles, put them into a bag and posted it
