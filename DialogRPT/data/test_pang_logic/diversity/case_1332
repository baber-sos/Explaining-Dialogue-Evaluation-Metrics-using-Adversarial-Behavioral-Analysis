[Spoiler] When the dust has settled, how do you rank the fight Rogan dubbed GOAT, amongst other classics? . We're talking about Sanchez vs. Melendez, of course .
The wildest brawl, not the greatest mma fight lol
It's not even really the wildest . I think Brian Stann vs Wanderlei has it beat
True, that was wild . Although this one lasted longer and had that crazy cut and Diego going into beast mode.
