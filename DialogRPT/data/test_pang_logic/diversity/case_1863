I just want to know what it would feel like ..
You could just attach a pole to your back that goes upward and holds a camera . That would probably be orders of magnitude cheaper and basically the same thing:)
It would be a whole lot harder to stabalize, though . That camera would be bouncing like crazy every time you moved .
Camera stabilizers are a thing .
That would probably bring you back to square 1 as far as cost goes though
Can't you just put a camera on a chicken on a pole on your back . (URL)
