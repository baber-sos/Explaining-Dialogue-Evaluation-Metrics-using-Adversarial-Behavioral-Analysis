Wigan's Callum McManaman set to be banned for Haidara challenge.
As an American, the ban term is always strange to me. I always see a "ban" as a for life thing and a "3 game ban" as a suspension.
Mention you're American and you get downvoted. Well played r/soccer. EDIT : I am wrong. Sorry for jumping the gun. I downvoted myself.
