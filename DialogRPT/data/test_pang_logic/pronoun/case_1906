NHL Pokemon Logos: I've been working on these ever since that SJ Sharpedo post..
I'm sad because I don't see this working with the Oilers logo, since it's literally just words in a circle. But there are a few round "ball" shaped Pokemon...
I know! Man, I won't be able to make it look exactly like the Oilers logo, but I am determined to make one with Muk or Grimer.
