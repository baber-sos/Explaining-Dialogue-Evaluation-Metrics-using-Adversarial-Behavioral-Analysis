Found a week-old kitten in a box on the side of the road.
You had better get some real help for that little thing ASAP. It's not going to eat cat food yet.
We've been feeding the little guy milk through a pipette, but I feel like that won't sustain it for long. Any advice? This is in Senegal...vets don't really exist here.
I raised some tiny kittens like this, it is a lot of work but that pup will love you forever.
