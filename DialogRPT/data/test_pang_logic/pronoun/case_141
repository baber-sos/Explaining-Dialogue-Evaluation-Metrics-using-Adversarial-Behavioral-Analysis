TIL how cucumbers become pickles
TIL pickles aren't their own vegetable. My whole life is a lie
I can't quite tell if you're sarcastic or not but I didn't know that until I was in college... I also learned tootsie rolls are chocolate that same day...
Honestly couldn't be more serious. Also in college right now, you and I, man, we're basically twins.
