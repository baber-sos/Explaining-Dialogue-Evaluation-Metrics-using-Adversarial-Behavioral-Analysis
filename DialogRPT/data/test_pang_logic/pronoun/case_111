Canadians today.
To those who don't know. We did our thanksgiving already. American thanksgiving is now underway. I don't remember why we have different days for the damn thing, but we do.
Earlier harvest up north.
Makes sense.
Yup, It's been winter here since November 1st
Maybe it's winter where you are, but in my neck of the maritimes it was 12 degrees yesterday. apparently winter is interchangeable with monsoon season here.
