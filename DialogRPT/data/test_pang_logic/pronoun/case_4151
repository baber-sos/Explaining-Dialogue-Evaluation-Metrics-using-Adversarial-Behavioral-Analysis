Judge that sold children to prison only gets 28 years.
"*only*" 28 years? That's 3 times as long as the average murderer serves. I think it's more than enough.
You think 28 years in jail is justice for 4,000 wrongfully convicted individuals? Holy shit.
28 years is a long fucking time. Besides, most of them will or already have had their convictions overturned.
IMO, it doesn't matter that they had their convictions overturned. The man should receive the same punishment he was paid to mete out.
