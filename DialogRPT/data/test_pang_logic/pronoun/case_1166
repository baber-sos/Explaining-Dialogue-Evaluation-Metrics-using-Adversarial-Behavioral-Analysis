France Football claims to have evidence that Qatar has been chosen to host WC 2022 by bribing. Details should follow soon. [FR].
I hope there is some substance to this would love to see some drama at FIFA.
I would just love the see the world cup somewhere that isn't Qatar.
Australia! We felt so ripped off by Qatar! Edit. I'd love for it to have been in America. Keep it in the family :)
Then again our bid video presentation was so cringe worthy bad it gave me cancer just from watching it.
