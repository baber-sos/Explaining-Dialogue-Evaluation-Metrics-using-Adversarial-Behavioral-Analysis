[SPOILER] My guess for the next episode.
Yeah I feel like next episode we might see a vengeful and hate filled side Tenzin. Kind of like when Katara snapped.
Screw air bender peace philosophy, one fifth of the known airbender population is at stake (not counting the newborn yet). Tenzin better go bananas.
If you aren't counting the newborn then it is one fourth. Tenzin, Jinora, Ikki, Milo.
Korra is technically an airbender. Being the avatar and all.
But she wasn't BORN an airbender, so she can't pass down any airbending genes, even if she is the avatar. Only Tenzin and his family can do that.
