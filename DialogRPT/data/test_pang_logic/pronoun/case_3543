Women of Reddit, what do you hate that guys do but think that you like when they do it?.
Trying to be too 'nice' during sex. Ok sure sometimes, but other times please pull my hair, throw me around the bed and talk dirty to me.
One Chinese burn coming up,you...you...harlot.
see this follows my "sexy name calling rule" the more old timey it sounds, the sexier and less insulting the name calling.
GENIUS! I am calling my partner a trollop as soon as i get home! That is the beans!
