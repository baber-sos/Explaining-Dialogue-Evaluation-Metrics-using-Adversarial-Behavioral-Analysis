This is beyond saddening: Tigers starved to make wine from their bones..
It'd be more humane to just kill them than let them starve.
Since tigers are endangered and protected under Chinese law, "farmers" can't legally kill them, as the article points out, the captive tigers have to "die of natural causes".
Sickening. Crazy ass motherfuckers who do this. I don't care if they are poor.
