Aside from Orgasm what is your favorite NARS blush shade?. A short explanation would be nice too!
Does anyone really like Orgasm? I've never tried it but I always see people selling theirs on /r/makeupexchange... anyways, I use MAC Mocha pretty regularly.
I am a guy and I use it. The glitter doesn't transfer too too much and it adds a night reflective sheen. It's a cult color for a reason.
