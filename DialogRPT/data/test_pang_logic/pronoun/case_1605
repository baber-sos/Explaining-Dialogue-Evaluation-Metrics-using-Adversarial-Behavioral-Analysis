Bad overtake on highway turns into a head-on collision for the driver not at fault. [x-post from WTF].
Jesus Christ, that's brutal. Did the poor guy in the black car even survive that?
If I remember correctly, it was a family, and no, none survived. The driver of the silver car was fine though, in some sick twist of fate.
I hope you remember poorly.
