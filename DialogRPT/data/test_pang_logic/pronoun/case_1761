What is your favourite film that is generally considered to be rubbish?.
A Knights Tale. I know its crap, and the acting is extremely sub standard, but the idea of medieval contest combined with rock just pleases me.
honestly, i don't know anyone who doesnt like it! its got heath ledger, it's an anachronism stew, and it has Chaucer! whats not to like?
