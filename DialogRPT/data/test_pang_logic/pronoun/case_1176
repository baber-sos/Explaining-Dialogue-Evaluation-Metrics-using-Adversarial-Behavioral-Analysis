Firefox beats Chrome in Performance for the first time in a few years..
I've been using Firefox for quite some time. Mainly because it has addons that I actually use and they seem to be built better than the Chrome counterparts.
I'd never switch to Chrome because of their fucking tab rounded corners. It's the invention of the devil himself.
