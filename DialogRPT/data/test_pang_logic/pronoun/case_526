What current player at each position is a sure-fire Hall of Famer, in your opinion?.
If everyone retired today: Pujols, Cabrera, Jeter, Ichiro. (ARod and Manny if not for...) I think should: Beltran, Beltre, Ortiz. And Utley because I love him.
Has Cabrera played enough seasons? I forget the minimum to be considered for the Hall.
Wasn't he on the 2003 Marlins team? That would be 10 years, no?
Yes, thank god he was.
what a both great and disappointing year for me to get into baseball
