psst.. you do know you are naked right?.
Why are there so many comments already about her pubic hair? Has it become so unusual that it's really worth talking about?
A girl having a bush is pretty taboo nowadays. I haven't seen one in the wild since 1997.
judging from the style of naked-girl's shoes and whispering-girl's pants, this picture is from the early 2000s or so. the bush may be long gone by now.
