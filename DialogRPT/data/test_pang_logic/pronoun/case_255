Why alien blue?.
Try Optimal mode. It's not always useful, but Quickmeme and YouTube are the two places it is.
And Imgur. Not for albums though. I really hope Jase will put in something that only enables optimal for images, memes and YouTube.
This is how it works in the 2.7 update that should be out before too long.
