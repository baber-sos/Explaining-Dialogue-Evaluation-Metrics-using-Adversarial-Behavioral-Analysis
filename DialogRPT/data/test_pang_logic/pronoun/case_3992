There’s a country that will pay $300,000 per rhino horn to cure cancer and hangovers, and it’s wiping out rhinos.
I can almost understand shelling out 300k for a rhino horn if you have cancer and you're desperate. But, shit, HANGOVERS?! It'd be cheaper to just keep drinking all day.
that would depend on what you're drinking
Unless you're drinking liquefied rhino horn, it's probably cheaper
I was honestly sitting there thinking what you possibly be drinking that would cost $300,000 a day... Nobel prize winner's sperm?
