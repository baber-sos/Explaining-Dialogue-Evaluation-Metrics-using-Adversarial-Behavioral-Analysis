Welcome to Australia.
It might be the lack of reference for scale, but am I the only one more terrified of the giant bat demon than the snake eating it?
I am also questioning the existence of giant demon bats. I don't if I am ever going to be able to sleep again
[They don't exist, go to sleep.] (URL)
But, [Wikipedia] (URL) has them!
"Wingspan up to... 4 ft 11 in" HOLY SHIT "Weights up to... 3.2 lb" Okay, never mind, we're good.
They're really cool. Like a dog with wings.
in Germany they are actually called Flughunde which means "Flying dogs" ;)
