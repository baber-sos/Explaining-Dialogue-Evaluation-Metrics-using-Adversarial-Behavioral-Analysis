Sometimes you see Justin Timberlake in concert...sometimes he photobombs you.
was not expecting dudes but ok
I'm 33 and listen mostly to metal. I fucking love Justin Timberlake. I'm not alone. Dude is awesome.
I like him and all, I just don't listen to the type of music he puts out. Its very talented, just not my taste.
