What movie have you watched that was much better than expected?.
Cabin in The Woods. the name, the commercials, everything about this movie suggested another crappy horror flick. But I just watched it and holy fuck was it good.
I was very excited for it, I love horror movies, cheesy or not. And it still exceeded my expectations.
