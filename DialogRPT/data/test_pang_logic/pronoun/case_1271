Oh shit!.
The first guy who bailed probably only had some nasty road rash. The driver with the camera probably died though.
My biology teacher calls motorcyclists "organ donors." And as much as I (really really badly) want to get a motorcyle.... that scares the shit out of me.
All the ER docs I've met call them the same thing. There is a reason they use that term...
