What's a pet-peeve of yours that others may consider irrational?.
Phone calls late at night. I always think something bad has happened....
If it's past 11pm, I tend to answer the phone with "What's wrong?" since something better be wrong.
11pm? I get pissed at 8pm if someone calls me. I gotta get up at 3am dawg, don't be bothering me with bullshit.
