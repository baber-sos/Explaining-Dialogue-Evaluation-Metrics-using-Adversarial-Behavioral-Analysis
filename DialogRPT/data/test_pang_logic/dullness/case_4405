EC: Ancelotti has given his OK to Florentino for the pursuit of Gareth Bale, and the sale of Gonzalo Higuain.
If Real sell us Higuain and buy Bale they can be my second team next season.
Higuan + Callejon + 20 mil = Fair trade for Tottenham!
Higuain + DiMaria = Bale, maybe? but then we will be argentine-less for the first time since my memory serves me.
bale is worth more
