repurpose them shits!.
Does no one else question the idea of putting a large quantity of kerosene in the most fragile glass object any of us know and then adding flame?
I'm pretty sure those aren't actually repurposed lightbulbs, but rather gas lamps made to look like lightbulbs.
Exactly, those bulbs were not "re-purposed". In fact, all of the items would cost more to re-purpose as shown than going out and buying the actual core product.
