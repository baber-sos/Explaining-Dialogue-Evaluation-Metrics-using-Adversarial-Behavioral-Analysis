Because in other places of the world, we use a system which make sense! Go Canada!
Canada is a cesspool of units. They can't decide if they want to used metric or imperial, so they shift between them at random depending on what they are doing.
Sometimes, it's easier to use feet to describe things because meters are too long and decimeters are weird, but other than that we use metric everything else.
