What is the farthest you have gone for the sake of a joke?.
Took a picture of my cousin's balls, set it as a wallpaper on a friends phone, made it password protected, didn't write down the password.
You probably shouldnt take photos of your cousins balls.
He could claim it was a model home in Iraq
That's a pair of balls!
