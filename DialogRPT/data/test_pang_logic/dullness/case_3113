You're actually quite safe. That snake isn't going to be doing much of anything for awhile other than digesting his meal.
Yup. Worst that could happen is that the snake gets scared and regurgitates its meal to flee quickly. You know, because it's probably very gross.
But how awesome would that be to see? Amirite?
Not so awesome when the snake decides that you look like a better meal and throws up his previous dinner to choke you down instead.
