My wife took this picture on March 31st in Central Park, NYC. Pass it on if you recognize them.
In the age of engagement photos and YouTube videos and all that.. It's nice to think about a couple just quietly enjoying the moment without the need for an audience.
I proposed to my wife while she was cooking dinner...mac and cheese as I recall..
That's what I'm talking about.
