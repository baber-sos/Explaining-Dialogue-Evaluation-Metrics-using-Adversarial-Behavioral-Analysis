So I ended up on the local news this weekend...no regrets..
Now that you're famous, I'm going to treat this like it's an AMA. What beer do you like? How drunk were you when they took this picture?
Haha I don't think I was that drunk maybe 2 or 3 beers in. Light lagers. I was sipping on an oatmeal porter at the time.
So this is an AMA now? What were they interviewing you about? Also what kind of job prospects can a beer consumer like yourself expect?
