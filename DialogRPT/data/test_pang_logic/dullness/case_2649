Nice quote by State Rep Sims on the bible and the Constitution..
Wait... As a Brit this confuses me. Isn't the simple act of having to swear *on a bible* kind of unconstitutional?
No politician, even the president, ***HAS*** to swear on the bible. They can choose to swear on whatever they wish.
"technically". Obama would not be president if he didn't swear on [TWO bibles] (URL) just to make sure. They don't have to, but it's political suicide to not do it.

I am very happy to hear that.
