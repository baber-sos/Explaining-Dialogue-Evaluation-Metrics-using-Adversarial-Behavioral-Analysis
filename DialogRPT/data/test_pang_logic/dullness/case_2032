Bank robbery this morning in my town (nobody will notice the bush behind the Dodge aiming an M16).
All I see is a car and some *shrubbery*
Maybe the robbers are the Knights who say Ni... they took hostages and demanded a nice shurbbery..
But recently they changed their name to the Knights who say ecky, ecky, ecky, pootang ZOIP-BOING. And now, they demand another task!
