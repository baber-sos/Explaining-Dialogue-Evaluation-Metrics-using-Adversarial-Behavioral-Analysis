Hey reddit, I made this neat game that helps people learn a foreign language. Hope you like it!.
how many languages can you learn on it so far?
So far just 7 but we're working on adding new ones to the game as well. We currently support English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, and Bulgarian.
Message me when you add Latin :)
Are there people that speak Latin? We need fluent speakers for audio pronunciations...
History students with an emphasis in classics/ancient history are required to learn Latin fluently.
