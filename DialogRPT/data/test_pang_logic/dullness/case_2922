So my Aunt Jo has been feeding 9 stray cats. This one's my favorite, Reddit met Red eye snow lion :3.
Has Aunt Jo gotten them fixed?
Aunt Jo doesn't have the money to fix them all; I believe there's 9 cat totally coming and going.
There are humane societies and rescues etc that will fix them at no or very little cost I'm pretty sure, just have to catch em
