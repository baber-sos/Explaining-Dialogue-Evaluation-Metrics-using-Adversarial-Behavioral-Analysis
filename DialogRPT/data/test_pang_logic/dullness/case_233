The Kentucky version of "crying wolf".
As someone from Kentucky, I can confirm that Kentucky bingo players don't fuck around. I was almost kicked out for laughing too much with my friends once.
What area of Kentucky has a large bingo community? I'm in Louisville and have never found one, but I want to. Shit gets more intense than Uno sometimes.
I'm in Louisville and people do indeed take their bingo seriously. It is fun though, and closer than driving to the boat to gamble.

I don't have a good answer to that.
