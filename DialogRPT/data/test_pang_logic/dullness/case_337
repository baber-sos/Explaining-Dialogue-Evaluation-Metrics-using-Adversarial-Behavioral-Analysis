Where are all my introverts at?.
what if i told you that just because you get energy from being by yourself doesn't mean you don't have opinions or emotions.
We do have opinions. We do have emotions. We're not that interested in sharing them with people.
As a fellow introvert, I disagree with this generalization. I really like sharing my opinions and emotions with others.
