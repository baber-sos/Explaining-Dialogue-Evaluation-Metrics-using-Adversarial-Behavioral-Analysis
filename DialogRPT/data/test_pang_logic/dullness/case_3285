Trying to rescue photos from a windows netbook using Ubuntu usb drive but the windows partition will not mount..
1. Try posting to these forums: (URL) r/Ubuntu is not really a support forum. 2. What methods did you try to mount with? Graphically in nautilus? udisk --mount /dev/sda1?
Graphically as well as through the terminal. Also tried forcing it.
If you open a support issue in (URL) I could help diagnose the issue. reddit's comment-tree format is rediculously stupid to try to provide support in.

I am happy for you!
