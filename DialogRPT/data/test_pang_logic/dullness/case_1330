kids that young should not be drinking soda
Wtf? Why not? Is there some other meaning of the word soda outside of America? I thought it only meant soft drinks and fizzy water.

Soda is mainly water and sugar. Sometimes there's also caffeine, when there is it isn't much. Are idiots thinking the bubbles cause cancer now?
It's not good for you. Did you not know that?
