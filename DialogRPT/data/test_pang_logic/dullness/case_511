Derrick Rose-- Pacers great, but Heat only true rival.
The Heat probably roll their eyes at the Bulls as much as the Bulls do the Pacers. "Oh, those guys we gave the gentleman's sweep to think they're our rivals..."
I like the term "gentleman's sweep". Be kind to them, let them have one on their own floor for the fans, then tidy up.
Bulls won in Miami.
