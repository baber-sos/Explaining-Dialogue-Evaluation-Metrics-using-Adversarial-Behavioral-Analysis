Hubble: Saturn's Aurora.
Is it so grainy because Hubble was designed to look at stuff MUCH MUCH further away?
I think its either because of distortion or because its old.
Indeed, the Hubble telescope was sent by Edwin Hubble himself in space.
Fascinating how he sent it to orbit with nothing but a trampoline and a tall building.
