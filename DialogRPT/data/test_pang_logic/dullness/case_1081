Cano agrees to 10 years $240 million with the Mariners pending a physical on Monday..
Well, I'm glad it's not the Yankees spending that type of money. Goodbye, Robbie. Thanks for the memories.
I feel the same way. What a horrific deal for the Mariners.
Because Tex, Ellsbury, CC, ARod are terrific contracts for the Yankees.
* Tex? Yes. * Ellsbury? Yes. * CC? Yes. * Arod? No. Fuck that guy.
Sorry, Tex at 8/180 hasn't looked good since he hasn't been hitting and has been hurt. And CC is making more per year than Cano will most likely.
