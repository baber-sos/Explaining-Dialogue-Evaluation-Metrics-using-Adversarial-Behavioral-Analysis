Peasant thinks a PS4 got a GTX 760 and it costs £1000.
As an owner of a very nice GTX 760, I feel deeply embarrassed.
Until I went back to playing bf4 in ultra.
At what resolution/fps?
If you are wanting a serious answer, the 760 gets about 80 fps at 1080p
That's pretty nice, I'm getting the 780 so it must be around 100. Thanks.
