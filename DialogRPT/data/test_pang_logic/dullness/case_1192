I just got my first tattoo, it's a badass skeleton unicorn!.
I hope you're kidding. It's fucking dreadful.
How is it dreadful? I think it looks really good.
As long as you're happy.
I am happy with it, I'm just curious why you think it's dreadful.
I just think unicorns are terrible, and the skeleton thing is sort of played out. It also looks really drab and bland.
