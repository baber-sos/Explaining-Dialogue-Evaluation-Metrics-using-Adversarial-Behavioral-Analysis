it doesn't get more scumbag than this.
If it's your ex why does it really matter? Unless you hang out with both of them now.
the act is scumbagish because you're low to ask use drugs as an excuse to hang out with someone
or maybe, as a drug user, he just wants to find someone else to get high with who won't judge him?
