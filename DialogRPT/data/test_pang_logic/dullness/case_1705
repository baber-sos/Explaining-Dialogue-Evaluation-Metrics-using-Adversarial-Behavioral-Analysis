This is the last thing I did on my PS3. Wouldn't want it to go out any other way..
I hope you still have your ps3. I wouldn't think selling it was worth it.
Yeah, it's not like the PS3 turns into a pumpkin the moment its' successor system comes out. Hell, I played my PS2 until 2011, long after I got my PS3.
