TIL that hand-warmers are filled with iron, and the heat comes from the process of the iron turning into rust when exposed to oxygen.
Isn't combustion oxidation? Edit: science words
You're not wrong, combustion does involve oxidation, but oxidation is simply the process of losing electrons. The most common use of the term generally refers to rust though.
