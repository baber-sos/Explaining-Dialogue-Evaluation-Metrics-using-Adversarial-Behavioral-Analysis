Three liters of beer. Because Germany..
You either slam that shit like a champ or be subject to warm beer!
yeah that is too much to actually enjoy. By the end I'd be hating whatever I ordered, and be jealous of the people that ordered multiple smaller vessels.
A good German (Bavarian) beer still tastes good while warming up. As an Aussie who was in Munich for 6 weeks my thinking about beer glass sizes changed quickly.
I believe they are actually meant to be drank at room temperature. Possibly wrong, but I remember that from somewhere.
45-55 F is about right for most beer. Ice cold helps cover up the shit flavor of crap beer.
