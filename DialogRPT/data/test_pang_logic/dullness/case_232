The Kentucky version of "crying wolf".
As someone from Kentucky, I can confirm that Kentucky bingo players don't fuck around. I was almost kicked out for laughing too much with my friends once.
What area of Kentucky has a large bingo community? I'm in Louisville and have never found one, but I want to. Shit gets more intense than Uno sometimes.
