Anyone else notice that Robin's sister completely disappears after season 1? I think it's weird that she's never in any of the flashbacks to Robin's childhood..
not to mention Ted's Sister, who LIVES IN NEW YORK.
I suppose the two characters weren't essential to the story of how Ted meets the mother.
