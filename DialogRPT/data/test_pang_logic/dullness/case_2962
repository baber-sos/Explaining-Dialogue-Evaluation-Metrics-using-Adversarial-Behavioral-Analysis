Head movement (x post from r/gifs).
He's almost Anderson Silva-esque in his head movement right Joe?
Looking at things like this I can't see how people can even begin to compare Silva to Ali, Ali was a million times better at head movement than Silva.
If Ali was so good at slipping punches then why does he have super parkinsons now?
super parkinsons has a 100% landing rate
