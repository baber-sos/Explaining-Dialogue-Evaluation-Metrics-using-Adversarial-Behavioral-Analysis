What's your most downvoted comment?. Just wanted to see how much you guys have pissed other redditors off.
I made a comment about JFK ruining the interior of a classic car.
To be fair, it wasn't classic at the time.
Could you even consider it "classic"? It was custom built as a presidential car with armor plating and all that.
Wait was it really? What's the point of armor on a car that has no roof?

Wow, great question!
