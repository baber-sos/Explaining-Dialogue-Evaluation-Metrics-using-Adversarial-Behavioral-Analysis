Whenever someone says 'If you don't like it move to...' who has never applied for a visa..
Came from Iran to the US in 2002, didn't get a green card till 2010. It's extremely difficult based on where you're from.
Just a curious question, is the US-Iran relationship overblown? I've always thought the media was exaggerating.
if it's any indication even canada just closed their embassies and cut ties with iran.... CANADA... so yeah the US and Iran aren't exactly friends.
Why can't we be friends?
They attacked our embassy and took them hostage. That's a no no.
But why did they attack our embassy? Oh, we sponsored a coup against their elected government and installed a dictator we liked more. Sounds fair.
People tend to forget about that part.
