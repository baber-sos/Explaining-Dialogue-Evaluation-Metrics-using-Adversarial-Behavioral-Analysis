What is a 'useless fact' that you know?.
That the first bombings from planes in World War One, were literally just a guy in the back throwing bombs out.

That sounds so much more badass than what they do now. Imagine still doing that with modern jets. The pilots would have to be gods.
Well when you plane goes faster than a pistol round you would need to be a god, or just one unlucky son of a bitch!
