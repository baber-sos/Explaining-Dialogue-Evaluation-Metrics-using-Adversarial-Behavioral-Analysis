Welker's contract: 2 years, 12 million.
Okay so seriously, what does Bill have up his sleeve?
Amendola, I think.
Nah that can't be it. Amendola is at best a marginal downgrade. He's a piece.
Ehhh, aside from injury concern amendola and welker are very similar. Plus we have edelman for the "small, feisty, white slot receiver," as well.
