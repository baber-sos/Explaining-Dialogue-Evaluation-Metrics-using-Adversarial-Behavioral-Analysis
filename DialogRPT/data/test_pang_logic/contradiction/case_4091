(6) Georgia Bulldogs survive in an OT thriller against Tennessee Volunteers 34-31..
As an unbiased fan of cfb, this was one of the most fun games to watch all season.
We seem to do that a lot. USCe, LSU, now UT. I was 22 at the beginning of the season. Now I'm at least 40.
Yeah, don't forget Clemson. Just because you lost doesn't mean it wasn't fun to watch!
