So my old middle school is now banning girls from wearing skinny jeans or yoga pants because they are "distracting" to the boys..
It is really hard to find anything other than skinny jeans if you look around a juniors department.
Kinda pisses me off because I *don't* want skinny jeans. I want straight-leg jeans, but Levi's stopped making them.
I have to go to the lady's department because my ass is always hanging out of low-rise jeans, which is just about all of them. No cute pockets for me.
