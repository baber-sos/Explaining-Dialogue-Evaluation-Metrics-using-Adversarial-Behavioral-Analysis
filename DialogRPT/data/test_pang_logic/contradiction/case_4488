If only I could reply from my iPad and it knew where I wanted it to go..
I don't get it :/
I could have all of my messages redirected to my iPad through iMessage. Only issue is I'd still have to use my phone to reply.
Wait, I thought that as of iOS 6, you could use your phone as iMessage on your iPT, iPad and Mac?
