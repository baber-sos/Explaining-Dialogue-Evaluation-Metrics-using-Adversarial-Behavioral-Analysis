How most drivers are in Arizona..
As an Arizonan, this highly amuses me.
Me too, from my experience people either continue driving fast and cause accidents or drop down to the speed limit and set their wipers on sonic speed.
At least they do the speed limit when it rains. In San Antonio they do 10-15 under. It's fun to go out and count car crashes
