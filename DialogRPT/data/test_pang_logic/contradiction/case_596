My girlfriend has gotten into extreme couponing. She got paid $10 to leave the store with this....
Can this be done in Canada? Ive heard it can't due to different laws. Also, can someone teach my girlfriend to do this?
Manufacturer's coupons here suck. It's a lot harder here than in the States. P&amp;G, Johnson and Johnson, and some others have coupons online you can have mailed to you.
