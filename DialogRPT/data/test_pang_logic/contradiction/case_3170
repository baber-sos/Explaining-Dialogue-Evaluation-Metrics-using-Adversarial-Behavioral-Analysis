For a tournament with a 30.600$ prizepool and only 4 players - its pretty quiet about this.
Um, why are Swedish holding a tournament to give NaNiwa $20,000?
To grow the swedish esports scene. 'Murica, take notice! ;)
We did take notice. Shoutcraft america. Too bad 1/4 of the players dropped out for no reason.
Wasn't that shoutcraft canada?
