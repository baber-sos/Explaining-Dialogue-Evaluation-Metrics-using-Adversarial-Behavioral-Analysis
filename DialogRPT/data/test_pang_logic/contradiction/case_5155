Can someone explain to me why DK ban timbersaw instead of nature's prophet?. Edit: Thanks for all the answer. I think early spectre pick screwed up their draft.
Honestly, I have no idea. Nobody is banning Prophet against Alliance and it confuses me.
The problem is that you're wasting 2 bans against a single player on Alliance, which lets Bat/Wisp/Cancer/great mids slip through.
