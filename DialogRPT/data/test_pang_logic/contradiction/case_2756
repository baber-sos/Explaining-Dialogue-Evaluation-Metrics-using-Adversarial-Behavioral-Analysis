TIL: J.K. Rowling lost her billionaire status because she donated so much of her money to charity..
"lost her billionaire status" is a strange way of saying "is not a billionaire anymore".
The billionaire police came by her house and cut up her billionaire members club card, it's all very official.
She is no longer invited to the billionaire summer camp.
no, not the millionaires summer camp...
I own a local hockey team!
