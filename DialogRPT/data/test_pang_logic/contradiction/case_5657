Google Maps rolls out update for Android/iOS, includes Waze traffic/accident avoidance (via Maps FB page).
What I really want is multiple stops en route and a better search function, so I can, for example, find the nearest gas station and put it on my route.
Agreed. Or keep the current nav point and trip, but add a realtime nearby food, gas, ect, function.
