60-year-old furiously biting 28-year-old teacher over a seat in Guangzhou Metro.
As usual, someone just sits and records.
This is in china what did you expect? If you tried to help you'd probably get sued by both parties involved.

IIRC in China if you help someone they can force you to pay their medical bills.
