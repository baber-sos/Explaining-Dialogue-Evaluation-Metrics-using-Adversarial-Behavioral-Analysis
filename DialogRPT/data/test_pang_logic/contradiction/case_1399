X/Y SPOILER GRENINJA IS FREAKING CONFIRMED..
They should have kept the cloud as a scarf. The scarf looks like an ugly tongue :(
I don't understand why they would emphasize the bubbles for the first two evolutions and then just throw on a tongue for the final evo.
I guess the same reason why they emphasized Braixen's tail-stick and then took it away for the final evolution. :\
Maybe something we can all identify as Chespin's will be taken in his final evolution?
