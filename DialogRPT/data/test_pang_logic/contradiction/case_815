Anyone else notice that Robin's sister completely disappears after season 1? I think it's weird that she's never in any of the flashbacks to Robin's childhood..
I love how two of the girls from Pretty Little Liars have appeared on the show.
I'm binge-watching PLL on Netflix right now. Good stuff.
I did the same! Watched all the episodes in about a week. I need a life
