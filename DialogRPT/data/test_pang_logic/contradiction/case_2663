What class would you like to see in Neverwinter?. Just curious about what my fellow players are looking forward to. Personally, I REALLY want a Ranger class.
Easily Monk. This game needs more Kung Fu.
Its based on 4E, so monks use Psionics, and if we're getting the Psionic power type then I suggest, nay, DEMAND the Psion class.
Psionics aren't really a staple of the Realms. Minflayers seem the closest to use them.
