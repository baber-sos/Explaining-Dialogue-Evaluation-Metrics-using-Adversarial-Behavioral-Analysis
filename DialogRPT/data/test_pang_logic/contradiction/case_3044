Finding someone else in r/gaming who also does not own GTA V.
I just personally don't find that game appealing.
I only played 4, and tbh I only finished it to make it worth the purchase.
TBH, 4 was terrible. Vice City and San Andreas were awesome.
To call 4 terrible is pretty harsh. I didn't like it because of how they tried to make it more raw and real, which actually ruined most of the fun.
