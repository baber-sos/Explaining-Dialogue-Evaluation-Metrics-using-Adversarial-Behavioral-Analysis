I see answers like this almost every time I check okcupid. Does it drive anyone else crazy?.
Yeah, this is up there with people who fill in the base of Maslow's hierarchy on the six things question.
YES. This is the fastest way to make me feel bored.
My favorite is when they start to reach a bit at the end of it: 1. Air 2. Water 3. Food 4. Shelter 5. Um...family? 6. God, maybe?

My ducky is when they depart to achieve a moment at the destruction of it : 1 . strain 2 . piss 3 . food 4 . shelter 5 . Um ... family ? 6 . God , maybe ?
