What's the creepiest way to say I love you to someone?.
I knew of this kid that jacked off into a napkin. He then gave the napkin to a girl and said this is my love for you.
All I can think of is your stereotypical Redditor doing this. As he sets the napkin down, he whispers "I'm just going to leave this here."
