A new picture of Michael Fassbender as Magneto in Days of Future Past. I like the outfit so far..
I have yet to see a very good Magneto costume.
I'm surprised he doesn't go for an insane mind-powered iron-man type suit. This would be my first move, especially if I was planning on overthrowing the world.

I 'm surprised he does n't go for an harebrained mind - powered iron - humanity eccentric suit . This would be my first move , specially if I was designing on subverting the world .
