Redbull to possibly bring back what MLG might leave off?.
Red Bull I swear to god I'll buy a 4 pack and drink it during the LAN event if you do it.
All SC2 players drink redbull like its the last resource on earth. I JUST LOVE THAT STUFF!
Monster doesn't get any respect.
Except during EG's games, in which case we all drink Monster.
Pfft, I only drink Bawls like all of my Quake Live heros.
Bawls is still the best tasting energy drink around if you ask me. Too bad it's nearly impossible to find where I am.
