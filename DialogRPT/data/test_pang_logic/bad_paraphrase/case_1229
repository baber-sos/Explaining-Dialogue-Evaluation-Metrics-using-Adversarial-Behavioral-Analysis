What minor thing in movies and shows almost always breaks your immersion?.
In action movies when the hero fights a ton of henchmen and one punch practically kills them, yet he hits the villain the same way and nothing happens.
Dark Knight Rises. Batman can completely incapacitate every criminal in Gotham in 2-3 blows but Bane is fucking immune to being punched in the head.
