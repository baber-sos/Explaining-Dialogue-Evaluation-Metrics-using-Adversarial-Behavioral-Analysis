How to make a font from your own handwriting..
Do people still own scanners? I remember scanners were hot shit before digital cameras hit main stream. I wish they would have this support through smart phones.
Many people own an all-in-one now: printing, scanning, and faxing. I didn't try it, but I'm sure it'll work with pictures as well.

Many masses own an all - in - one now : printing , scanning , and faxing . I did n't render it , but I 'm certain it 'll bring with scenes as well .
