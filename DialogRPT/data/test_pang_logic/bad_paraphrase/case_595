Go peeing??
I've always called the mysterious act "The after piss" always felt like it's cleaned the leftovers out.
I do believe he was pointing out the fact that it could have just been "Go pee" instead of "go peeing" This bothered me too.
"Go peeing" makes it sound less like a necessary bodily function and more like a fun activity, like he's gonna go skipping down the street, pissing everywhere.

" Go peeing " throws it vocalise less wish a necessary somatic occasion and more wish a merriment activity , ilk he 's gon Na go decamping down the street , piddling everywhere .
