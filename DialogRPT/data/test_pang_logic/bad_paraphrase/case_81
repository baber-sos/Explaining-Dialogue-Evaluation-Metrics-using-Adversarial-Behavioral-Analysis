Americans will never understand this level of luxury.
Where is this supposed to be? Hopefully not Europe. I've been to several European countries, the toilets left much to be desired... like an actual toilet.
Where have you been that you were unhappy with the toilets?
France. I clearly missed the childhood lessons were you learn to poo into a small hole whilst standing.
