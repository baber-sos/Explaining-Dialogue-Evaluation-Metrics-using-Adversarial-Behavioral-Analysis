What's one possession you have that's completely unique to you, that no one else in the world could possibly have?.
I own the only purple Perkins Braille writer. It's like a Braille type writer. Usually they are gray, blue or green. Mine is a gray one painted purple. (URL)
Wait a second, if Braille typewriters are made for blind people, why do they bother making different colors?
Why do they make coloured clothes for blind people, may as well dress them in white onesies. Just because someone is blind doesn't mean they can't be an individual.

Why do they make non-white dresses for unsighted people , may as well clothe them in livid onesies . Just because someone is unreasoning does n't signify they ca n't be an individual .
