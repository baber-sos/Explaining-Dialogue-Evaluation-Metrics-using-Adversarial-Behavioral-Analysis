I've worked months to build this Assassin's Creed III Tomahawk. Finally done! (with version 1.0).
Sweet! Is it just awesome or is it usable for practical tasks too?
This version is just awesome. Next version will be fully functional (hardened steel blade with a sturdy walnut handle).

This rendering is just awesome . Next reading will be amply useable ( inured sword sword with a uncompromising walnut handle ) .
