The Count is so ridiculously over the top. Less than a minute into his scene, and he's already my favorite villain in the series.
While I don't love the big change to Count Vertigo's backstory I think its implementation is extremely well done.

While I do n't fuck the bragging alteration to reckon Vertigo 's backstory I reckon its execution is passing well done .
