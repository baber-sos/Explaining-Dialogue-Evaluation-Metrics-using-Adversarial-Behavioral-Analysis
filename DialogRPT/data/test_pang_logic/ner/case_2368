I'm going to miss seeing BarcodeKiller play in NA.. Not to mention the rest of the [Worlds summoners] (URL) playing on NA.
I wish I could see him Duo Queue with someone on stream for a few games like Piglet did with Saint. Faker with Scarra commentary would be magic.
HotshotGG asked to add him and maybe duo some but Faker said he didn't add people onto his account.
