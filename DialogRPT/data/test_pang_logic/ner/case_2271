Americans should expect acts of terror: Our violent attacks abroad increase the chance of retributive attacks at home.
American citizens don't attack abroad. We don't deserve that shit. Our government is separate from our people.
No it's not. The US is a democracy, the people *are* the government. Americans don't get to keep for voting shit then walk away from owning it.
The people havent voted on the conflicts our military has been in. Hence, we've had no say in it.
Americans voted for their policymakers.
