TIL that in Ancient Rome, if people wished to commit suicide, they applied to the Senate and, if their petitions were approved, were given free hemlock..
Senator (shuffling through papers): "So, what makes you think you're the best candidate for suicide? Do you have any references?"
related, how demoralizing would it be, to be told you're not even good enough to be approved for suicide.
It wasn't that they're denied, it's that they have to pay for the hemlock instead. Even so, it does give the impression "You're not GOOD enough for our free hemlock"
Fridge logic: or that you're so good that the government wants you to take an extra step and rethink your decision to deprive Rome of your valued services.
