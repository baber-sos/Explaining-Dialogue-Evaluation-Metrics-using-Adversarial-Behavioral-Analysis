NYC bars pouring 12-14 oz. 'pints' of beer.
Our local CAMRA chapter here in Vancouver has fought for a while to make it mandatory for places to post how big their pint and their sleeve actually are.
CAMRA's slogan for this is FUSS-Fess Up to Serving Sizes! Also, here in Vancouver, a Pint is 20oz and a sleeve is 16oz! I love Canada.
