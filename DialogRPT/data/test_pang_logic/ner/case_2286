Joe Flacco almost never uses social media, but tonight he posted this - a rare candid moment for him and something that makes me respect him a lot..
Joe showing emotion? Shit...
He was hilarious after the Super Bowl. He doesn't have that "showy, the cameras are watching" emotion that certain middle linebackers do. It was real, normal guy emotion.
"Fucking Awesome!" -Joe Flacco
"This is a positive experience!" -Joe Flacco
