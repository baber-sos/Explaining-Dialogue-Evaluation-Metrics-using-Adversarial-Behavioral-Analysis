North Korean girl with pot on her head does 90 spins in 30 secs to celebrate Kim Jong Un's birthday.
If she wasn't doing it so halfheartedly she could've easily done 100. To the firing squad with her.
For real though what kind of asshole aims for 90 when 100 is only 10 away
Only in North Korea.
***You have been banned from /r/pyongyang!***
Praise the glorious dexterity of north koreans.
*You are now a mod of /r/pyongyang!*
Oh, North korea is good. Sooooo...
You have been banned from /r/pyongyang! North Korea is great! Not good! Edit: On a side note, I have actually been banned from /r/pyongyang. Tis a sad day.
