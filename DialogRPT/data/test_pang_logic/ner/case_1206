A few weeks ago, me and a few other Redditors from /r/minecraft started up a vanilla server. Here's what we have so far. More screenshots coming soon! [Album].
If you guys are alright with it, my girlfriend and I would like to join. A reddit community server sounds awesome.
Sure thing! The more the merrier! The server's not whitelisted or anything. PM me your skype names and I'll send you the IP.
Can't you just pm whoever wants play the IP? I would like to play but I have no skype.
