If we had to to eliminate one state from the United States which one would you want it to be?.
Canada here. We'll take Hawaii off your hands.
How about you take North Dakota in exchange for Quebec and we'll call it even.
Please, just take Quebec
Never! Quebec will never be owned by the stupides Americains.
Maybe Quebec and Louisiana could make their own special country together.
