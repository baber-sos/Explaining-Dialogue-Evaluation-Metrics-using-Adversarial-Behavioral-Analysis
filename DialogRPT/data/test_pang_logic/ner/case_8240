After seeing pictures of the Boston bombers, I may want to consider a haircut..
Just get a white hat to cover up your haircut!
Also, wear a backpack, and fill it with random hardware equipment to draw attention away from your face.
And if anybody thinks that they recognize you, just make a run for it. You can always explain the misunderstanding later, better safe than sorry!
