Hey reddit, I made this neat game that helps people learn a foreign language. Hope you like it!.
how many languages can you learn on it so far?
So far just 7 but we're working on adding new ones to the game as well. We currently support English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, and Bulgarian.
oooh, which ones are you working on adding? Any chance of Russian?
