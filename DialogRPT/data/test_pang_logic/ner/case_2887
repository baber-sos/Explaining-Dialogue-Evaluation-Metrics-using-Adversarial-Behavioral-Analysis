Which teams are most clearly tanking?.
There is only one true answer.
The Suns.
We traded our only serviceable player away. Right now the best player on our roster is Evan turner or Thad young. That hurt me to say that.
I actually think Thad Young is a good player, but obviously not as your best player. He's a great hustle guy.
