[Get Games] Get Loaded - two games for £15/€18 /$24 - incl. F1 2012, Civ V Gold, Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed, Carrier Command and more!.
Carrier Command and P51 Mustang are **non-steam**. This offer ends 48 hours from now, so 4pm Sunday (BST) Sniper Elite and Sleeping Dogs are not available in Germany. Apologies.
... and Sniper Elite V2 and Sleeping Dogs are **not for Germany**, which is pretty sad :(
Sorry, I was only just informed.
It's ok, us Germans can't have fun shooting people. It's *verboten*. Even if it's Hitler we'd be shooting at.
