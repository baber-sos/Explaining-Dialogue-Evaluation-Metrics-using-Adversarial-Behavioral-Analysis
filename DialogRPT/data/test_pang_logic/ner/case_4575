My Nexus 4 just started updating as soon as the conference hit three hours. Google Music now look beautiful.
The streaming service is awesome so far. I've been using it for a few hours now. It's like Pandora and Spotify had a baby.
And its cheap to! From my understanding its $7.99 a month if you use the free trial before June 20th
Which is great, if you live in the US and the trial is available to you.
I'm in Ireland and the trial is available to me. Maybe that's because I set up Google Music a few months ago though using an american proxy
