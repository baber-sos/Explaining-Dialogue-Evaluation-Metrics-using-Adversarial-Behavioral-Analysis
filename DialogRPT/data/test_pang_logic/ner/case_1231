Se6e08 Discussion Thread. Se6e08 "The Crash". I didn't see a thread for this up, 12 minutes before showtime, so here one is.

I don't think Joan's character would have worked in this episode, she has too much self-control to go nuts like everyone else.

I don't think the Nikka Factory's character would have worked in this episode, she has too much self-control to go nuts like everyone else.
