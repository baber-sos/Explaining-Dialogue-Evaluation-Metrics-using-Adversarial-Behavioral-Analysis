Dog cuddles are the best cuddles..
Aw, I have a Jack with pointy ears too :)
They are the best. Although she has one ear that points and the other flops over!
My jack was like that! He was so flipping cute, I miss him every day. But he did live a good long happy life so this is what counts.

My Nexus 5 was like that! He was so flipping cute, I miss him every day. But he did live a good long happy life so this is what counts.
