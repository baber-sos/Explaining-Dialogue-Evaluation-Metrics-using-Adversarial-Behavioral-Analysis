Hate Atheists? Hate Gays? You might want to reconsider..
Am I the only one who thinks it would sound better as "gay atheist" rather than "atheist gay"?
yeah, using "gay" as a noun seems iffy. Like "black." Saying "black people" or "gay people" sounds okay. Saying "the blacks" or "the gays" sounds wrong.
"I'm a Puerto Rican" "No, I know that's what *you* call yourself, but what can I call you?" "A Puerto Rican." "Wow, that... really doesn't sound right"
