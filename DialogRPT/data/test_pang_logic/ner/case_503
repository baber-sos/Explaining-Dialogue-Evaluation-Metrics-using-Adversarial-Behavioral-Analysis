Something I noticed about Dragon's Dogma. And this is coming from someone who has spent over 250 hours playing Skyrim..
If you think this is epic. Look up a game series called Monster Hunter. Dragon's Dogma is kind of its spiritual successor. [=)] (URL)
Well Monster Hunter is still around, there is just not a lot of hype around it though. I even heard about a PC version a while back.
Am I being foolish or are you referring to the same Monster Hunter that's on Wii U?
