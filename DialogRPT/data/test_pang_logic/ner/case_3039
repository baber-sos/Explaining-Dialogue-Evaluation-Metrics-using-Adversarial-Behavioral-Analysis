[GG] Fallout New Vegas (no DLC) - $5.
€2.50 in Germany. Nice! EDIT: ~~Remember to use code IAMANELDERGEEK for antoher 5% off.~~ EDIT2: Code still worked earlier today, but doesn't seem to work anymore.
Is it German only and cut like when you buy it on Steam though? The forced German dub already ruined Bioshock for me.
