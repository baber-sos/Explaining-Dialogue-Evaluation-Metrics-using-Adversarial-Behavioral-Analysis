Based Volvo. Thank you based volvo for diretide EDIT: Whoever changed the banner is a genius. Well plaid mods, well plaid
Thank you r/volvo and Volvo itself for tolerating us through this whole debacle.
Now leave us in peace. (And see you next year!)
Hope not!
But I'll miss you guys :( Guess I have to buy a Volvo now so I can stick around.
