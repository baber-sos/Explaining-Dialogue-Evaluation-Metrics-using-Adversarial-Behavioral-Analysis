When 3D printers are more affordable, I want to be able to design my own Phone cases, figurines etc. What software should I start learning to use?.
If you have a.edu email address/are a student, you should be able to get Autodesk Inventor for free. Much better than paying out the nose for Solidworks.
Solidworks offers student copies for free as well.
