Final 10 Rarest LOL SKins.
That guy has a great voice, felt like I was watching a countdown on tv. Please make more!
Top 20 most common skins?
Assassin Master Yi, Riot Tristana, Unchained Alistar. GG.
Assassin? Where did people get that one? I have Samurai Yi.
It's the cheapest one at 390 RP. Oddly enough, it's the only Yi skin I don't have.
Is yi a good champion? I play him a lot and he's definitely one of my favourites.
