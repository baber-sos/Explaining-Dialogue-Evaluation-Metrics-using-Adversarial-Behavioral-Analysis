What do Neapolitans think of Neapolitans that are Juventini?.
Did the sign at 0:43 say Juventus are shittier than Torino? Sorry, my Italian isn't very good.
It loses the rhyme when translated to English which makes it funny, but basically Juventini from Napoli are worse than Juventini from Torino.. which I agree.
So many haters. I think those fans are just smart.
