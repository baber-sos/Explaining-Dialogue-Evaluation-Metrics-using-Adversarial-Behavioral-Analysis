Reddit, what is something you know about your significant other that they think is a big secret?.
That she farts.
She should see a doctor.
"Let's see...yup, you're definitely not supposed to fart. I'll prescribe some medication. That should take care of the problem."
"This isn't medication... It's just a cork, are you sure you're a real doctor?"
