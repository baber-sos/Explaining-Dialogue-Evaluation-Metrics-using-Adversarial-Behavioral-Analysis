Pitbull vs. Porcupine. Took two other vets and myself over 2 hours to remove all quills from mouth and throat..
Jesus fuck, does the porcupine look like a naked mole rat now?
Mole rat meat is a good source of protein while wandering through the wasteland.
Actually, porcupines are a woodsmans friend. Despite the quills, they are slow and easy to catch and kill. De-quill, skin, cook, and tada dinner!
