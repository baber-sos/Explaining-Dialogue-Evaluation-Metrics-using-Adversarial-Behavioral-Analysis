One of the only things I've remember from elementary school..
Can someone tell me how every kid in every elementary school in the country was trying to draw this logo? How did that shit happen before the internet?
I am from the UK. When we were around 11 we were drawing it here. I have no clue where it came from.
I invented it. AMA.
Would you rather fight 100.... ahh fuck it
I would rather fuck it.
For a 15-year-old boy, this is a valid answer to *any* question.
For a 20 something year old man it is still valid, except for crazy.
