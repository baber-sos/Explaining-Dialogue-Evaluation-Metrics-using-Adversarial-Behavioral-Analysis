[GPU] XFX Core Edition FX-785A-ZNL4 Radeon HD 7850 1GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 x16: $120 - $30 MIR = $90.
What would the performance for 3 of these in CrossFire compared to a 280x be?
Is it worth 2 of these instead of a 7870? Sorry bit of a n00b.
No. Always buy a single card solution with your budget instead of buying 2 at the same time.
