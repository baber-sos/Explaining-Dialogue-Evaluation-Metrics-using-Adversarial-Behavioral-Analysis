UK's 5 biggest banks lose 2.4 million customers in protests against banking scandals.
2.4m high street bankers are not an important part of these bloated megacorps balance sheet. Whatevs.
Another fantastic analysis contributed by someone in the know.
But honestly, the big UK banks measure their balance sheet in £billions, so /u/oasisoflight has a point.
2.4m people with £500 each is over £1bn. Granted, that's not to say they've lost billions in profit, but it certainly adds up.
I'm sure everyone will feel nice and smug when all of the innocent bank tellers and IT staff end up on unemployment lines. That'll really stick it to the man!
Yeah! The banks these people moved their money to are all operated by one guy and a team of dogs.
