Co-worker asked me what I think Nintendo's next handheld should look like. 10 minutes later I showed him this..
I'm loving the screen, I'm not sure how comfortable the right stick would be to use.
Probably not at all, but I had to include it.
I think it's a great idea have 2 sticks. My hands are huge though so probably wouldn't be ideal for me ;(
SUPER 3DS XL MEGA LARGE EDITION Would you like some extra large with that?
Super size me. *gets wii u*
I honestly think that's the best idea; take the wii u's gamepad and mash it together with the 3DS.
