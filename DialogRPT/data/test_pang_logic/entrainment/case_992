This dog comes to our coffee shop everyday to get a donut hole and it makes my heart melt..
So cute, I can just picture that dog licking my fingers after eating the Timbit.
I saw donut hole and came here to correct it to Timbit. You're way ahead of me mate.
I wasn't sure if people would know what a Timbit was but you are one hundred percent correct! I'm excited that someone else knows!:)
As an American, I had no idea what a Timbit was. And now I know. And knowing is half the battle.
