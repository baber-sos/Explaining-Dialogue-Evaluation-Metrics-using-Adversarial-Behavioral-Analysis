My favorite map size comparison for Skyrim and the other games in the series.
Am I the only one that want a non-mmo Elder Scrolls with entire Tamriel to explore?
i want a multiplayer (NOT mmo) elder scrolls game, basically a first person DnD, and because it isnt an mmo you can add mods into the mix
