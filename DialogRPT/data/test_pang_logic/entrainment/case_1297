What are your plans for TableTop Day? Are you celebrating? Joining an event? Boycotting?. EDIT: Don't actually boycott. That was a joke. Have fun. Play more games.
New FLGS in Fairfax VA. The place is clean, well lit, and ten minutes from my house. I'd feel bad if I didn't go.
Dude WHAT. Where is this place?! I drive to either Huzzah Hobbies out in fucking Ashburn (bumfuck nowhere), or go to Game Parlor in Chantilly (dark and depressing store).
