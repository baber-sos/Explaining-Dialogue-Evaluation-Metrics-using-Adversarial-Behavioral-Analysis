1v1 me noob
You might be thinking, they will have no excuse with no teammates to blame. [Let Idra teach you.] (URL)
Problem is, playing it has just confirmed I am a god at 1v1's, and thus the only reason I lose is because their noob jungle camps me.
Play champs like Karma, Riven and Tryndamere that turn enemy ganks in to kills.
Depends on the jungler, sure if it's eve you can, but not a voli...
dude, If you play riven and then enemy mid and jungle gank you, you just take a triple kill, then you teleport bot for the penta. Simple as that
That would work, but after you get the triple you're out of mana.
