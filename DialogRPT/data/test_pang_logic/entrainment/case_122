ever have one of those days where you shouldve stayed in bed.
Did the rider go under the truck wheel? Edit: The rider died :( here is some more [info.] (URL)
Yes. I'm about 70% sure that was his head that the truck went over.
The other 30% was his body.
So that equals 100% dead.
100% reason to remember the name.
