Read this in a newspaper this morning.
In peru people eat guinea pigs, so I guess it's not as bad as eating horse.
Horse is actually a fairly common food in some places of the world. I have intentionally eaten horse before. I really don't see the issue with it.
I had a horse salad once. The meat was kind of dry and had been grated.
