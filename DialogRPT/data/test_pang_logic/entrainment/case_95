Reddit, what gives you the best non-sexual pleasure?. (Excluding taking drugs)
Sneezing. When I don't sneeze I get pissed because I missed such a good feeling.
I mentioned to a friend once that I really like the tingly feeling I get in my head right after I sneeze. He said I should try sniffing glue.
