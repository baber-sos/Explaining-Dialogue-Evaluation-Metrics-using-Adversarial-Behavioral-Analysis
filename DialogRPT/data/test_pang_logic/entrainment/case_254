What little things make you irrationally angry?.
When people take forever to text you back just to be cool
Especially on an IPhone when it says they've read it.
Whoever decided to add that feature to an IPhone is an asshole. It makes avoiding annoying people without looking like a dick almost impossible.
You know you can turn it off, right?
Can I still see if they read it?
