Don't do laundry when drunk...
Don't put cards in your pocket.
Just this, this, this and more this. No rubber bands either.
I have all my cards from each set rubber-banded together. Is that a bad thing?
Generally you need the rubber band on tightly to keep them together, which will damage the outermost cards, unless you have very wide rubber Band.
