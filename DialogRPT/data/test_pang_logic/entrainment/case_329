Where is Jagr going to end up?. I'd of like him playing with national and lockout teamate Tomas Plekanec but it seems he won't be coming to Montreal.
I'd love to see him playing with Elias and Zidlicky. Hell, let's get Sykora again and have a Jagr - Elias -Sykora line. We'll call it the "Czeching Line."
