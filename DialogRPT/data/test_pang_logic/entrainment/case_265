1.0.7 is coming tomorrow!!.
so are there official patch notes yet?
[The current ones] (URL) might be the final result. Did they say they were going to change anything else since they updated the PTR patch notes?
I saw something about changing set bonuses. But they didn't say if it was going to be 1.07 or not.
I think that is in the next major patch
