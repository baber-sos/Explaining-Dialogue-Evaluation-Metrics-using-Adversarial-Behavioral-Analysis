What film do people misunderstand the meaning of?.
I think A Clockwork Orange. People think Kubrick is just being violent for the sake of it, when really they probably couldn't even tell you the meaning of the title.
I still don't know the meaning of the title, all I know is it was taken from the book of the same name. Explain it to me?
