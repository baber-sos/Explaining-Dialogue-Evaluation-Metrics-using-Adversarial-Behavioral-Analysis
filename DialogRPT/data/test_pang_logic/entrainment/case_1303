My cousin is getting married, so our family is meeting the groom-to-be's family. Name tags were made!.
They left out Grandfather?
Maybe he passed away?
This is for the couple, right? Logic stats there at one point was 4 grandfathers. Odds may not be in this families favor if they all passed away :(
