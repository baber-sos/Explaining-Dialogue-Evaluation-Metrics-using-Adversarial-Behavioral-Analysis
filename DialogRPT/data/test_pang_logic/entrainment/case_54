Australia drops in global corruption ranking.
Wouldn't it be a good thing to have a lower corruption ranking? What am I missing here?
The scale they use is from 100 (least corrupt) to 0 (most corrupt), Aus dropped from 85 to 81
Well that's a bit silly, why not have a scale that makes sense intuitively?
