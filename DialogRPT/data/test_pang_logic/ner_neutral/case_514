Next Week NA LCS is HUGE: TSM vs CLG, TSM vs DIG, CRS vs DIG, and CRS vs CLG.
CRS vs DIG will be the match to watch.
With TSM vs Dig as the secondary attraction.
Is Chaox returning next week? Or will it still be WildTurtle?
I'm sorta hoping it will be with WildTurtle. I want to see how TSM does with him against the top NA teams.
