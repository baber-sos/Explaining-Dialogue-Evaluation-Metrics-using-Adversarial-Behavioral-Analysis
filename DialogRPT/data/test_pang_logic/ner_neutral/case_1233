Respawn only recently found out about Titanfall's lifelong exclusivity. "Of course we will [make games for PS4], just not the first Titanfall".
Sounds like they intended to have it on PS4 after the launch period ended and Microsoft threw sacks of money at EA to make that not happen.
Smart move by microsoft. Titanfall is definitely a next gen defining game. All other really hyped games(watch dogs, destiny, the division) are multiplatform.
