My sister wanted a couple wedding pictures at her favorite pub but ran into another bride....
I see the King of Canada has also made an appearance! All Hail King Cherry!
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's a law in Canada to have at least one picture of Don Cherry present at every wedding.
Yes, but Ron MacLean is only optional.
But he is always by Don's side so he is "optional" but not really.
Rumour is that Don Cherry's been dead for years (taxidermied) and Ron MacLean is the best ventriloquist the world has ever seen.
Ron's always been the more talented one.
