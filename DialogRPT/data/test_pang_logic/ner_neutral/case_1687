Ben &amp; Jerry’s Is Going Non-GMO.
I think we should re-orient ourselves from anti-GMO to anti-Monsanto. If B&amp;Js decided to ban all ingredients that resulted in a royalty for Monsanto, I'd support that.
Would this not effectively do that?
Monsanto sells hybrids too...
And in the past they also manufactured and sold DDT, PCBs and Agent Orange.
