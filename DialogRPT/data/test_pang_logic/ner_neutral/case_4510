(Spoilers ASOS) "Three Characters Confirmed Being Cast for Season 4".
Can't wait to see who they'll cast in those roles. Naveen Andrews, maybe?
One of my favorite actors. I would love him in any role. They could have cast him as Joffrey and he would instantly be my favorite character.
i agree. just can't seem to imagine sayid yelling "You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children. Now say her name."
