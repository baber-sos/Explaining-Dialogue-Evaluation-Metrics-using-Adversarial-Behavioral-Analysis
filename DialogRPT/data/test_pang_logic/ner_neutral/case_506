[Release] HiddenSettings5s - Hidden Settings for A7 devices (Read the description before installing).
Apples going to patch this now. Great job.
Uh, Apple is going to patch the whole jailbreak, not individual tweaks.
It's not a tweak. PrototypeTools.framework is inside any retail firmware dyld cache. It's probably going to be removed now that everyone is posting how to enable it. So thanks posters.
