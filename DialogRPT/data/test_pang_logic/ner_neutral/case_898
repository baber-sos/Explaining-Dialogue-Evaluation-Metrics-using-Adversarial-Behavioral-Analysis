What do you think your team's starting XI will be in their first game of the World Cup?.
I'd imagine Roy to set up like this. - Hart Johnson Cahill Jagielka Baines. Gerrard Carrick. Walcott Rooney Welbeck(/Lallana) Sturridge
bar Rooney and maybe Cahill I don't think ANY of these spots are definate at the moment.
After everything that happened I can't imagine him not playing Carrick.
