PS4 sells over 250,000 in UK – 66% more than Xbox One.
Is there really that much of a difference between the two consoles? I am not even interested in buying one. I am just curious.
Only REAL difference is that the ps4 is cheaper due to the fact that it doesn't have kinect, An annoying novelty to a lot of older gamers.
Is the PS4 slightly more powerful as well? I heard something about xbox one can't run full 1080p?
