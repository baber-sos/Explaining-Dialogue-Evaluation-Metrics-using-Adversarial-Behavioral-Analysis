Stupid Questions Thread. **REMEMBER TO SORT BY NEW!** Have fun guys, and remember, there are no stupid questions here.
Question with the pokemon transfer coming out soon. Can I move Pokemon from heart gold to white 2 using a ds and 2ds, or do you need two ds's?
You need two systems
But between the two systems, its ok if one is a 2DS and the other is just a regular DS? They don't both have to be the old DS?
