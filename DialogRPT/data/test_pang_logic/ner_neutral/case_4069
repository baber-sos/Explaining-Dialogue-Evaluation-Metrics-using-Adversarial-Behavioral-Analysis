Mike Rowe recently posted this to his Facebook. With the caption "Sometimes, Kari Byron from MythBusters feeds me french fries. I don't mind.".
Mike Rowe is probably the only celebrity I'd ever want to meet. I respect him and admire him greatly.
ditto. plus he seems genuinely funny and I'm sure would have a bunch of awesome stories.
