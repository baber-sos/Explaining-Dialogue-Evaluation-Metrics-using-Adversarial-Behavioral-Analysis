Damian Lillard game-winner vs Pistons.
Reminds me of Brandon Roy.
YEP, except it seems like Lillard scores a little more effortlessly and is not as rough on his body...
I don't think Lillard will ever be the scorer B Roy was. Roy was on his way to being an elite superstar. Lillard is amazing but he's not B Roy.
