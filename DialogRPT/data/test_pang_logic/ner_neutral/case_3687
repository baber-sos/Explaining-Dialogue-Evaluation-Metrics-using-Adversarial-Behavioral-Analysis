GOP blocked 19 requests to negotiate before the shutdown.
They can't negotiate because they need to demonstrate how intransigent Obama is.
For the others who have no idea what the fuck intransigent means: Intransigent 1. unwilling or refusing to change one's views or to agree about something.
I also had to google it before submitting just to make sure that I was using that word correctly.
