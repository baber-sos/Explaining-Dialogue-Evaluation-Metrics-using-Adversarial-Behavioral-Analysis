Why is Zach always the person in these memes? Found on /new..
I don't know what you're talking about. 90% of the time it's Will Ferrel.
I fairly sure that 98% of the posts here feature either Galifianakis or Ferrel.
So then, You're saying 49% of the time it's Will Ferrell. SO ZACH IS NOT *ALWAYS* THE PERSON IN THESE. LIAR.
