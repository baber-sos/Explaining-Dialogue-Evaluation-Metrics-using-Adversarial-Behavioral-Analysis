What actors will always be a specific character?.
Tobey Maguire will always be Spider Man.
Unfortunately, yes. But the newer Spider-Man was really pretty badass.
The new Spider-Man was lame. No badass points awarded.
I personally thought it was better than Tobey Maguire's "Look at me, I'm Tobey Maguire" performance.
