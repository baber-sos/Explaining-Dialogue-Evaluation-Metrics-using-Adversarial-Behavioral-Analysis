After spending a weekend introducing my European friends to American girls....
I've heard it doesn't work like that. Foreigners are so used to hearing American Accents in pop culture that it holds very little novelty in other places.
American living abroad here bcbill is correct, not only have I found that my "accent" does not entice women, some girls instantly write me off because of it
Maybe you just suck at getting women, regardless of country. ;)
Well, it's only an accent if the person is attractive. Otherwise, it's a speech impediment.
Oy, blyme, wuja loit ta hop in the sack wi' me? "OH MY GAWD HE'S SO EXOTIC!
