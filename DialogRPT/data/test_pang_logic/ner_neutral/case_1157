Remember that guy with the 1820 pound pet buffalo? He lives down the road from my in laws. Here he is taking him for a car ride..
I..I thought this was established. *Bison*?
Yeah. There are actually significant differences between a bison and a buffalo. It'd be like calling a beagle a wolf or something. Close but not the same.
Except that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service disagrees with you. (URL)
I mean they're not in the same genus. Buffalo come from genus Bubalus. Bison come from genus Bison. Seems pretty clear cut to me.
