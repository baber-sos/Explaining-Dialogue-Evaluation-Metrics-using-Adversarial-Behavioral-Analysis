I'm absolutley obsessed with Batman, but....
You're not alone. I miss the Animated Series from the 90's.
That was my favourite animated batman show. I find it hard to get Into the new stuff
The new stuff makes it seem like Bruce is such a DICK. Like more so than usual, which isn't fair to him. Also the villains are just not original anymore.
