Pick a sport, and change three rules to make it ridiculously dangerous. What would the rules be?.
Tour De France 1. All drugs are legal, including heroin. 2. Wooden tires 3. The fans have their own scoring system.... so look out.
First rule won't change anything...
Lance Armstrong would get all his titles back.
