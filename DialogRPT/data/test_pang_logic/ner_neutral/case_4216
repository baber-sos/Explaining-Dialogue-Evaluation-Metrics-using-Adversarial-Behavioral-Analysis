Chris Kluwe on Ellen.
I was sad when they said he was going to punt but the video was ending...
Me too. I wanted to watch him punt. Chris, I know you are looking at this. What did you have to do?

Why didn't I think of doing that... Thank you. That was pretty impressive. Macklemore played too. I have to say, I probably would have watched this episode.
Kluwe tweeted that his kids were more happy to see Macklemore on TV than him.
