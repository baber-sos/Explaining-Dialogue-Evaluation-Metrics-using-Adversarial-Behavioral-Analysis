Which video game character do you think has died more than any other in history?. I'm no expert. What are your thoughts? Edit: Thanks for all your input! (URL)
Sean Bean
Why does his name not rhyme?!?! You can only be "Seen" Bean or "Shawn" Bawn, Not "Shawn" "Bean"
Sean is pronounced "Shawn", Bean is pronounced as it looks. It is "Shawn Bean"
