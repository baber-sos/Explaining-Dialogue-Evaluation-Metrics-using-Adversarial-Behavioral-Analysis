While Sony's enjoying a lot of good publicity let's not forget this dick move..
Sony does allow you to upgrade your PS3's HDD using any 2.5" SATA drive, though.
so if I put an SSD in one will load times decrease?
To an extent. It's capped at 3 Gbps (SATA II), but as shown [here] (URL) and elsewhere it'll definitely help. Depends on the game.
Aren't actual read/write rates way lower than 3Gbps? SATA II isn't a bottle neck anyway is it?
