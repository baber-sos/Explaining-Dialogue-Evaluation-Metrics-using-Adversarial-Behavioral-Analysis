For the second season in a row, MLS has reached 6 million in total attendance!.
According to wikipedia, the average is 18,807 per game. In our Campeonato Brasileiro we have 14,300 payers per game. Those are great numbers for the MLS!
18,807 is more then the English 2nd tier as well.
Eh, to be fair that's not really a great way to look at things. MLS clubs cover a huge population and area, second tier english clubs don't.
