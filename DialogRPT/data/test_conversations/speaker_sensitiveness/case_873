Andy Diggle officially off of Action Comics.
I was going to try this book but with this announcement before the book even came out, should I or anyone else even bother?
I would just to show support for the Diggle issues at least. He's a good writer. It's a shame to see he's gone.
I plan on buying the Diggle issues for sure now just to show support in my small way.
