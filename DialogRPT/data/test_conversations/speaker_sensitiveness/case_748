How is the Latron?. I've been looking for my next primary, and I've been looking at the Latron. Is it any good? I currently use the braton.
It's good for fighting Grineer and Corpus, you can hide and shoot heads. It's really bad against infested.
With the right mods you can one or two shot every infected except ancients. And even then they die really fast.
