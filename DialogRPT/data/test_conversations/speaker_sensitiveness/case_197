We stayed in a L.A. hotel with the bath tub in the living room. Awkward time with friends..
How is this acceptable, was it dirt cheap or something?!
It was around $90 for the night near the airport. I am not complaining, it's just the BATH was in the LIVING ROOM.
So what? You can sit in the tub and watch telly.
