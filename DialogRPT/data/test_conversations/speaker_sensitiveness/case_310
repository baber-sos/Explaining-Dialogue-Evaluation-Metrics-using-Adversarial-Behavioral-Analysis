What is the biggest way people waste money?.
Cigarettes. EDIT: Smoking's a bad habit, but it doesn't make you a bad person. EDIT II: Goldie.
I couldn't agree more. I have stopped smoking for 3 days now, I have saved $18 so far. It's been hell, but the money in my pocket doesn't lie!
Shit man, that's one packet in Australia.
Wait, what? The fuck. "Hey, look! He's smoking. that guy must be rich as fuck!"
Minimum wage is also higher, and the cost of everything else is higher too. It evens out.
But 1 AU dollar is worth less than 1 USA dollar.
