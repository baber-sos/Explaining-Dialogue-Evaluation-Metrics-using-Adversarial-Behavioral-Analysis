The cast of Return Of The Jedi, 30 years on. (X-post from r/starwars).
Is it weird that the wookie and the ewok look the best out of all those people?
Warwick Davis was 13 when he played Wicket. He's significantly younger than the rest of the cast (in his early 40s now).
I'll put in a plug for [his own show] (URL) pretty funny stuff.
