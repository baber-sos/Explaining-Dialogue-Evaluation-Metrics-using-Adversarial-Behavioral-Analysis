How would you guys approach making a "dusty" drumbeat like the one in this song?.
saturation and or overdriving the drums brings out the harmonic distortion which gives you the dusty or fuzzy feel.
Can you ELI5 to me what saturation actually is? I've seen it here and there but I have no idea what it is/does.
