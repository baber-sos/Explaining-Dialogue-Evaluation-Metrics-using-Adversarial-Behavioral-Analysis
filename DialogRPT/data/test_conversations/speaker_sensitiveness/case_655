What's something that fits the saying "don't knock it before you try it"?.
Peanut butter and pickle sandwich. Sounds bizarre and slightly unappetizing, tastes like a little bit of happiness and dignity. Give that bad boy a try, thank me later.
Peanut butter and banana sandwich. It's so amazing. No one I know has been willing to try yet.
