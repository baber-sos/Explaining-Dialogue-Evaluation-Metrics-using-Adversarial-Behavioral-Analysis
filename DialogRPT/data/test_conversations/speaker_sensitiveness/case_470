Roy Hibbert fined $75k for "inappropriate and vulgar language".
Seriously, do so many people watch the post-game press conferences that a $75,000 fine is necessary?
Pretty sure more people have saw this one than any of Hibbert's others.
He got what he wanted. I'm already planning to watch more Pacer games next season. I don't want to be a mother fucker.
