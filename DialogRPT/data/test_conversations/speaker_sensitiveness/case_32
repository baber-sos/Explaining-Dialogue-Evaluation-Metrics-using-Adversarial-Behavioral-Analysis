How fast do you think is considered moving too fast in a relationship?.
Telling the person you love them after a week.
I love you.
I uh, look. I like you, but we're moving too fast. Maybe if you just got to know me a little better, I could like you more.
I don't love you?
I don't love you, too! :D
Let's not move in together!
