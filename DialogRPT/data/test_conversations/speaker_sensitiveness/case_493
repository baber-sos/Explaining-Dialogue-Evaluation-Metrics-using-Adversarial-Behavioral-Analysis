Are these rare? They're sitting on the shelf with no VHS to play them.
They are not super rare, but they are valuable to fans of the uncut series as they don't have any of Lucas' "improvements" from the late 90s special edition.
Are they worth anything? They have been sitting on my self and have not been watched in years.
