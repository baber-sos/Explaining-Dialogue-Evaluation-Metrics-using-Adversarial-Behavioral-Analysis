Random guy ran up, handed me this and said: "We don't sell pizza, but we do deliver.".
Why can't this happen to me?
Probably 'cause you don't live in the USA... Or atleast I don't, and this would never happen in my country. Sad, sad, world.
UK Here, I've been given business cards from some entrepreneurs.
