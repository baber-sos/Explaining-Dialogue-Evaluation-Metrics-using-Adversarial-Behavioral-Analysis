Trying to hatch a shiny Eevee using MM, then this happens when I accidentally entered a bush..
Would you be willing to trade it?
Depends on what is being offered in return
shiny audino?
Sure I'd take a shiny Audino, is it named? FC: 2251-4536-2753 Edit: Also did you want a specific name on the Sigilyph?
If that falls through I have a few shinies I can offer. PM me if interested.
