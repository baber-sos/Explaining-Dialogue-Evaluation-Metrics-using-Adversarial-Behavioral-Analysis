LF: Light Clay FT: 5iv Eevee or 5iv Cloyster. [6]
I've got one I'll trade for the Cloyster. Can you nickname it Goober though? IGN: Stachio FC: 3050-7792-4469
I can. It has rapid spin and rock blast bred in too. I'll be on about 10 tonight.
I'm not gonna be home tonight, but I'll add you. Just send me a trade request whenever you see me online.
Are you on???
nah not yet I'll be on in around 30 minutes.
Thank you.
