My 1st fancy dress half marathon. Got called Radiation Man, Iron Man, Batman, Power Ranger, and Superhero. Support was very welcome, but is this character that obscure?.
Since The Flash hasn't been in any movies since the superhero boom, I'm going to say yes from the perspective of the general public. And Apple.
But he has been in the Justice League cartoons, and Big Bang Theory (sort of). Maybe a Flash update is required?
