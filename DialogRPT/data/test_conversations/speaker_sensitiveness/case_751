A question for guys.. We all know that women don't like shirtless for guys, but what picture can a girl have that will automatically turn you away?
Shirtless is actually fine, provided it is taken in a place/at an event where shirtlessness is actually warranted.
Being shirtless in the bathroom is warranted...
