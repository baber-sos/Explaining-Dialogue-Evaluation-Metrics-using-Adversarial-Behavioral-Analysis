The best candy in the world, that nobody has ever purchased.
Does anyone else remember having their tongue sliced while enjoying one of these?

I think it has something to do with sucking the candy down to the point where the air pockets are exposed, creating a sharp-ish like opening.
People suck those? I'm not that patient.
