Free Shipping on New 9mm Ammo.
Even with free shipping it's very over priced
40 cents a round isn't "very overpriced."
I base all of my purchases off of pre-panic prices. A box of brass target 9mm was about $12-14 last year.
$10 @ Academy is my reference point (that is if you had one around you). Not the greatest ammo, but never had any issues with it.
Yeah you could get Tula or Wolf for around $10 in Walmart
