Damn you noodles!.
The girl is not me, no more creepy PMs please! Found this in the imgur gallery.
Are creepers really that fast? how many PMs in the first hour?!
Only a couple, and one that asked a/s/l...I didn't even know people say that.
Wait, people actually find random female users on Internet forums and PM them hoping to score? This makes me really sad.
