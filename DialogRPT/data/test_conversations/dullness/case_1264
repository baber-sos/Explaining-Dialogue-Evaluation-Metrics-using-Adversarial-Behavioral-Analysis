WWE.com "Where is CM Punk" (They even mention Chael Sonnen).
They could have done this two years ago when he left with the title instead of having him come back two weeks later.
WWE and CM Punk wanted his departure to last longer, however they had to sell SumemrSlam so they decided to go with it earlier on.
The extra buys from him coming back still don't make it worthwhile for me. They could have had a mega payday and angle down the line had they waited.
