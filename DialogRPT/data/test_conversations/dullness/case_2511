What is an unpopular opinion you have that would actually make people angry?. EDIT: Holy shit, reddit loves eugenics. I won't call anyone out but... *damn*
I always see redditors suggest that this site is full of the best and smartest. I believe that at least 90% of the people on this site are criminally stupid.
But let me guess, you think you're significantly smarter than everybody else. I'm sure the 90% thinks that of themselves as well.
