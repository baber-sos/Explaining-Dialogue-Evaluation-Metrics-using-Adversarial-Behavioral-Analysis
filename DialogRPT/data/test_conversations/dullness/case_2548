Ten things Christians need to know about homosexuality.
Showed this to my very Christian friend. Told him he judges people all the time. His response: "That's me as a person, not me as a Christian"
"me as a person, not me as a Christian" what does that even mean? he's a schizophrenic and knows it... some of the time?
