I provide Customer Service for NFL Ticket Exchange, AMA. I work for Ticketmaster and Ticket Exchange...AMA.
Can I be your assistant?
Absolutely! I could really use an assistant and I'm fully qualified to offer you a base salary of $0 plus free coffee.
Do you ever get to pick up free tickets, or if there are a couple remaining tickets the day of, do you get them for free?
