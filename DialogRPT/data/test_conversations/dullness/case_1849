Jon Gooch confirms - Spor album almost complete. Not to mention Seventh Stitch..
So, how many aliases does he have, and what are the theme for each of them? Have tried searching for it before, but kinda hard to find.
He's got, that we know of, Seventh Stitch (IDM/Experimental stuff), Spor (Nuerofunk/ DnB), and Feed Me (Electro house/dubstep).
