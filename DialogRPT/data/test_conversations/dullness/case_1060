Took this picture as an American travelling in London. I felt such shame..
i am british.. i have ordered this many times.. i regret nothing.
So is it an actual American style hot dog or some weird Eurpoean sausage thing? Also, is it actually *good*?
Well, if the media has taught me anything of late it's that it's definitely horsemeat.
