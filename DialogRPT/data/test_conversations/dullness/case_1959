Who would like to have a terrain editor in Halo 5's Forge?. Any reasons why it would or would not be a good idea?
I'd really like to see something like the Trials Evolution Editor for Halo.
Don't we basically... already have that? My understand is that Trials could aptly be called 2D always-phase forge... edit; I stand corrected.
