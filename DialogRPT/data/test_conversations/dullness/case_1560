All the college majors are in a bar. What is each major doing?.
Accounting major here. We would be haggling for net30 terms and a line of credit, offering to balance the store's books in exchange for bottles.
Finance major here, we would be stealing the bar blind as the bartender is occupied with you. Party at my place, all drinks are half price, 100% profit!!
