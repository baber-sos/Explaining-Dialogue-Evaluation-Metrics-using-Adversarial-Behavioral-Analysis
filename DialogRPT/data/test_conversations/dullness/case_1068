What is the most disturbing fact you know about the human body?.
We carry poo and pee in us at all times. We don't think about it until we actually go to the bathroom, but everyone has some inside...at all times.
As do all of the animals we eat. It's the reason why any ground meat is the most risky thing you can eat. Feces *everywhere*.
