TorrentFreak says an IP address from the Vatican City is downloading porn.
You do know the Vatican isn't all clergy, right? Not everyone who works there regularly is even Catholic...
Kind if a null story in my mind. Actually I'm a little bit annoyed that torrent freak likes to share users IP information with the world.
It's totally ok when it's people we don't like like religious people. They don't deserve privacy /s

That is very interesting.
