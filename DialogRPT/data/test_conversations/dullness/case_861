Where can I buy a Condo for under 250k in NYC? Willing to look in Jersey. Will be commuting..
How far of a commute you thinking about? There are a lot in that price range. Especially if Jersey is an option.
I'd prefer under an hour commute. Where exactly in Jersey should I look?
hoboken might be too expensive for you but look north of that
How is the crime north of Hoboken?
Excellent crimes
So you mean that the robberies are "excellent"? Or the crime rate is low?
