Craigslist Find. Which the wife wouldn't kill me if I bought it..
$3500 is way too much for that car
true, I think that is their high hopes price. Everyone around here names their price and is usually willing to come down 1k or so.
For 2k that'd be a cool car to own, especially since they've owned it since day one.
