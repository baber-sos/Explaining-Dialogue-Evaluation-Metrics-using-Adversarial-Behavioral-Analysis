Jon Stewart Demolishes Megyn Kelly and Fox Freaking Out Over Santa's Race and the War on Christmas.
This Christmas, Jon Stewart and his staff should be giving thanks to Fox News. That shit just writes itself!
I've heard Jon comment that it's actually hard not spending every show just ragging on fox news, but that it would be lazy.
They should make a show dedicated too it
I wonder if you could do that? I guess it'd probably be legal. Just do an hour every day ripping apart the previous day's bullshit.
The show could even be called "Bullsh*t Mountain"
Spoiler alert: the peak is only an illusion. There is no peak, because the mountain never ends.
