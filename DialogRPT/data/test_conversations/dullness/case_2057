TIL That an 8-year-old won $1000 and gave it all away to his 2-year-old neighbour who has leukemia..
$1,000 at 8 is like $100,000 at 25.
or if your married with a 1 year old it's like $1,000,000 at 34
Why would you marry a one year old?
sorry... for a couple of things... "If **you're** married, and have a 1 year old baby. It's like $1,000,000 at 34." It's Monday and I forgot about reddit police.

That is a great question.
