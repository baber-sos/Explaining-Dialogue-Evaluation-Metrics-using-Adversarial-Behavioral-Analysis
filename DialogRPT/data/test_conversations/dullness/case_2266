Jonny_Watts correctly predicts the San Francisco 49er's record, which included a rare NFL tie..
I'm too lazy to look it up. How does a tie occur in the modern NFL?
The current rules consider the game a tie if no one has scored after one full quarter of overtime.
What happens after it's considered to be a tie?
A tie is better than a loss, so if you have two teams 13-4 and 13-3-1, the 13-3-1 will be ranked above the 13-4.
What happens if there's a tie in the superbowl?
Sack races.
