Idiot stay in your own lane!.
Idiot drivers like that is the reason why a majority of highways in America have medians.
Yeah, the setup in this one is pretty bad. I mean, 3 lanes in both directions with nothing between them..
Its in a city. EDIT: should have stated that i live in Europe, and medians are not common in cities here, at least not in Scandinavia.
I am from Germany, and we have medians all over the place. Especially when the road is 2 or 3 lanes wide, and you pick up some speed.
