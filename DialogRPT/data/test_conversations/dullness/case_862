Where can I buy a Condo for under 250k in NYC? Willing to look in Jersey. Will be commuting..
How far of a commute you thinking about? There are a lot in that price range. Especially if Jersey is an option.
I'd prefer under an hour commute. Where exactly in Jersey should I look?
hoboken might be too expensive for you but look north of that
How is the crime north of Hoboken?
Excellent crimes
