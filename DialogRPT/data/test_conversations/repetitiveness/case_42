I wonder if it tastes better this way ....
Bible or not my personal code of honor forbids me to ever destroy any book for any reason .
Me too, and I wish I had a perfect record, but I got really mad once about four years ago and ripped out pages of my bible . Still ashamed .
If you're truly sorry Jesus will forgive you . * snicker *
