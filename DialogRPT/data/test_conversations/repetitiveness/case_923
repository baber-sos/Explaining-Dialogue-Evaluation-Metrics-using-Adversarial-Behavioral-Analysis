Wife dropped me off at daycare today. Its gunna be a good day.
I think it is overrated to take your bf with you to go shopping. I rather leave mine at home.
I think I'm in love.
WHAT IS LOVE?
Its called leaving your bf/husband/male SO at home when you go shopping. There is no better experience than not shopping.
