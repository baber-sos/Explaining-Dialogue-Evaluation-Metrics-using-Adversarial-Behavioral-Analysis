Detox posing with his twin brother . So that's what he would look like without the plastic surgery ....
Am I the only person who finds Detox's need to constantly tell the world that he is a top to be a little bizarre?
Maybe there's still a big stigma attached to being a bottom, and his always mentioning about being a top is just a product of that?
