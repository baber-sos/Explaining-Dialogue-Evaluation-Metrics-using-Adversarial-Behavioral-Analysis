Not saying it happened, not saying it didn't; however, it was a good response.
I'll say it then, this didn't happen.
My friend is the one who posted this on Facebook. He's not the type to make up something like that, so I'm inclined to believe it actually happened.
Or he's just not the type to get caught making up things like that.
