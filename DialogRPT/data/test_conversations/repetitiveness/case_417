Busted out the SNES for my little brother. Minutes after setting it up, he quit because "the games were too hard"..
If you'd have busted out an NES and Megaman you'd have made him cry.
I even played that and it still makes me cry :*(.... still stuck on that level....
There's one with lasers against I think Speedman, noped the fuck out of that.
Quickman's stage. Basically needed flashman's weapon just to get by.
