City demands cyclist pay $1,200 for damage to a police cruiser that struck him.
If he looked behind him to see that it was clear, how'd he get hit by a car?
Either he somehow didn't see the police car right behind him, or the police really were far behind him and were traveling unreasonably fast/driving recklessly/not paying attention.
