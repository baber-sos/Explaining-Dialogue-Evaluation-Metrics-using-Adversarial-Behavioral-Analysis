Hilariously genius..
Gavin's secret room is the best part.
and the relentless mocking afterwards.
Everytime they give Gavin shit, and I feel bad for him, I just remember back to Episode 1 where he set their house on fire with Lava. That was amazing.
Then spent the next dozen or so Lets Plays setting anything and everything on fire. That fucking library in the stronghold was beautiful. poor books.
