Given that God is supposed to be perfect and loving, why does He find it acceptable to torture people for eternity?.
The concept of Hell is a lie, and based on idiotic interpretation of the Bible. This is coming from a Christian.
So Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and most if not all traditional mainstream Protestant sects are idiotic. What is the name of the non-idiotic set of Christianity?
