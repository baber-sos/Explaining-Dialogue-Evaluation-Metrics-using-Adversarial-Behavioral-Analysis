What movie have you watched the most times that never fails to entertain each time you watch it? .
The Other Guys . I don't think I will ever not be amused by that film .
"At age 11, I audited my parents . Believe me, there were some discrepancies, and I was grounded ." I love that movie, but it seems no one else does.
