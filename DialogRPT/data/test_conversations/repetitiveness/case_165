Noticed a new logo and "The New Xbox" on the Xbox site's banner changed for a few minutes. Any explanation?.
Do their web developers do quick previews from the actual website, or is that extremely unprofessional.
Unnecessary when they can just host an internal virtual environment running the exact same software and configuration as their production environment and use that for previews/testing.
