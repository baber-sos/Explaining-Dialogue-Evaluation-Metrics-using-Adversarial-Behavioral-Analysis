Tattoo artists in ABQ?. Hey all, I recently moved to New Mexico. Anyone have any recommendations on artists in the Central New Mexico area?
Stay Gold! Gold and Yale, right near the university. Talk to Matt or Daniel (they're the ones with the outrageous beards). Pablo's really good too. Best shop, best dudes.
whatever you do op DO NOT go to daniel, that bastard fucked me up :(
