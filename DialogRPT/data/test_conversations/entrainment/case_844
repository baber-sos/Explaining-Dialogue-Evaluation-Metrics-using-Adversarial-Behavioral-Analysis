For those of you still on iOS 6, A3Tweaks has something for you coming soon....
Why would anybody still be on iOS 6? Next thing you'll be telling me is that people still own 3GS's
Because iOS 7 looks bad? My iPhone 5 is still on 6.1.2 because I absolutely hate the Fisher Price look of iOS 7.
You think iOS 7 looks bad? Personally I think its a huge improvement, even if they did steal a load of stuff from Android lol
