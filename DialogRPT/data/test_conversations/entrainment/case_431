Ten years from now which celebrities wont be celebrities anymore?.
Lil Wayne is already slowly fading away.
Musicians live and die by their albums. He'll put out another and we'll see him again. Hell, Busta Rhymes and DMX are still out there, somewhere, putting out music.
But where is DRE?
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!
HA-HA
Feminist women love Eminem
Slim-Shady, I'm sick of him. Look at him!
Walking around grabbing his you-know-what, flipping the you-know-who. "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"
I've probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose but no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedroom!
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips! My bum is on your lips! And if I'm lucky you just might give it a little kiss!
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is!
