Donald Trump and Bill O'Reilly must be fun at parties.
To be fair, the wave is not cool and being forced to do it is bullshit.
I go to baseball games to watch baseball. The wave is for assholes who aren't paying attention. I hate those people. They may be distracting our players. Edit: seplling.
I think its fair to say that goes for all major sports.
I think it's most prevalent in baseball. Non baseball fans tend to get bored.
I think you baseball fans don't have anything else to do.
