Fulton County Shelter is overrun with kitties = No adoption fee! Discounted shots/spay-neuter services to boot! Go adopt a new friend. &lt;3.
I've tried calling them to find out what the screening process involves. I'd really like to get a new buddy tomorrow. Could anyone tell me what I should expect?
