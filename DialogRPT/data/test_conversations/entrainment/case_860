TIL Vin Diesel has played Dungeons and Dragons for 20+ years and had a fake tattoo of his characters name during the filming of xXx.
So would you say he's Chaotic Good in most of his movies?
Sounds about right, especially Riddick.
Isn't there a rumor that Riddick is basically his dream D&amp;D character?
I could believe it. What's better than the stone-cold badass with a heart of gold?
Two stone-cold bad asses with hearts of gold.
A stone-cold bad ass with *two* hearts of gold!
