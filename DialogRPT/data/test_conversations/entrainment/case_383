Holy crap! where is the guys who called the roy thing months ago.. come get your props!
I did expect Roy to be a P.I, but didn't expect Leander to be behind it.
What I'm stuck trying to figure out is why? I couldn't make out what he said to her after the Roy's reveal...
*"I owed Lewis something. I'm sure you can understand that."*
Ah, so it goes back to The Commodore, nice.
But wasn't Jimmy who killed him with a pitchfork?
Jimmy stabbed him with his bayonet after the Commodore stabbed Jimmy with what looked like a trident.
