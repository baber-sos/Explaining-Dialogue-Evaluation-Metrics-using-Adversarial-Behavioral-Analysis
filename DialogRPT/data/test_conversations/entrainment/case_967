But.. but... Freedom?.
TIL women are fatter than men.
boobs mess with BMI ratings
A woman's body is genetically designed to retain more body fat. However, women also suffer from a double whammy around age 50 with a major decrease in metabolism and menopause.
Triple whammy, really, when you remember they often also give birth and then never get rid of their extra baggage...
That's more of an excuse than a reason. The skin will be looser, but permanent weight gain isn't something a pregnancy should cause.
Is permanent weight gain actually possible?
