I only get to buy games once or twice a year so when I do I buy a years supply, I think it was a good haul..
You really should try dishonored. My goty :)
GotY really? Don't get me wrong, it was a great game but not GotY imo. I wouldn't have even payed $60 for it knowing what i know now.
I think i'm just in love with the stealth part... there aren't many around these days :(
