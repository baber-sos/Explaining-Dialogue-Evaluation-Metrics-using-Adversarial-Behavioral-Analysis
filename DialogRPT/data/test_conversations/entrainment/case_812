So guys, other than money,the American dream etc. What do you really want?. ^ whether it's a new book, or a lifestyle-Tell us a little dream of yours.
I want to be the Avatar. But seriously, I want a photographic memory. I could memorize language rules and vocab like that and just converse and practice all the time!!!
