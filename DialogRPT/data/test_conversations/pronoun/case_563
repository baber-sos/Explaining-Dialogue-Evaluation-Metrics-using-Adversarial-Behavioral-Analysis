Woke up to find a 40 caliber bullet was fired into my front door last night.....
Proof that.40 S&amp;W is a useless cartridge. Didn't even penetrate the door.
This is also a hollow-point round. not designed for penetration, but to expand upon impact. thats probably why it didnt go further into the frame.
