Westboro Baptists - don't say we didn't warn you.
Isn't that the point for WBC? They go to places and when people do something to them, they sue for millions of dollars or something?
I honestly wonder what would happen if the police department was disbanded for the duration of their stay. Could they still sue? Would they risk it?
