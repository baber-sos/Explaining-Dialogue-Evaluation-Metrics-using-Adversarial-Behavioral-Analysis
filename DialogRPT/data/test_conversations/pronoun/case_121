God posts pictures of Poseidon's Witness seal and Jesus dog, is chastised severely.
Who knew that the Christians' god would be the best internet troll to ever live?
The bible kind of shows he would be. I mean why put a forbidden tree with fruit in the garden of eden in the first place?
Especially since it was the tree that gives you the knowledge that it's bad to eat from the tree. Troll Level: Original sin.
