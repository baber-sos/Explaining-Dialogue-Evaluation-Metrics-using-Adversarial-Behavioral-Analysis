What's your most downvoted comment?. Just wanted to see how much you guys have pissed other redditors off.
I made a comment about JFK ruining the interior of a classic car.
Wow. Just, wow.
Yeah, talk about blowing your mind with the insensitivity.
Really. Try to show some brains next time.
Couldn't hurt to give it a shot.
The whole comment was way off-target.
Actually, it was right on mark.
