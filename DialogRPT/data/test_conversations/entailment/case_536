You are correct friend, I moved to Casa Grande about 6 years ago and these scared the shit out of me considering I'm from California
As an az native i used to put swim goggles on as a kid and go on the swing set during these (which were more common back then). No fear
How many times have you had Valley Fever?

A lot of people don't realize that Valley Fever comes from spores in the dirt...
