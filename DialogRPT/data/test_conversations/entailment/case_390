This made my day. (X-post from /r/facepalm).
I went to High School and didn't read the Great Gatsby, but I remember my friend did and his essay title was "The Moderately Adequate Gatsby". Haha good times...
I didn't read it in school either. I went to high school in Norway, though. We don't really read books in school here. It's such a shame.
