Anyone else notice that Robin's sister completely disappears after season 1? I think it's weird that she's never in any of the flashbacks to Robin's childhood..
There is a relatively big age gap between Robin and her sister though so her sister might not actually have been around for some of the flashbacks.

Bold move, how did she take it?
