TIL that the youngest medically recorded mother was 5 years old. Her son was born healthy and was raised believing that his mom was his sister..
Maybe NSFW image and the son was not healthy, but suffered bone problems and died in his late 30's
It's not NSFW. You Americans are fucking bothersome, even though most US redditors claim they're atheist.
Im just saying that at some places of work or school, a pic of a naked 5 year old with obvious and visible tits might be a problem.

I m just alleging that at some properties of workplace or school , a film of a nude 5 class sometime with obvious and seeable teats might be a problem .
