What actor or actress was absolutely perfect in their role?.
Johhny depp in pirates of the Caribbean, seriously I dont think any other actor could have have done that better than him.
Problem is that every movie he's in now just seems like a slightly different version of Captain Jack Sparrow.
Except for Hunter S. Thompson
Jack Sparrow is a slightly different version of his Hunter S. Thompson.
Nah, his Hunter S. Thompson is surprisingly like the real thing
Johnny actually spent a lot of time with Hunter when preparing for Fear and Loathing.
