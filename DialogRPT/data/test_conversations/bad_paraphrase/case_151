Adam Sessler's Review of The Last Of Us [PS3].
Man, I love Adam Sesslers reviews so much, and straight shivers when he says "a 5......out of 5...."
The review shows how passionate he is about gaming. Love the sess. Was quite shocked watching his review and then reading gamespot's review......I was like WTF??
