Reddit, what's something that you wish was socially acceptable?.
Talking to strangers. Everybody's so afraid of muggers and pedophiles, that its become "weird" to speak with someone you don't know
There should be sensible limits to this though: don't talk to the crazy homeless person ranting in public.

There should be reasonable bounds to this though : do n't babble to the half-baked stateless someone raving in public .
