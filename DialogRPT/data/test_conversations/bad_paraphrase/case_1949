WTF - batman cartoon on the children's network..
I'm pretty sure the comic and cartoon where not meant for kids. Which channel was it on?
It was on YTV which from my knowledge is an all kids channel. Unlike teletoon or teletoon retro.
YTV is not a all kids channel and I never knew they played batman.
