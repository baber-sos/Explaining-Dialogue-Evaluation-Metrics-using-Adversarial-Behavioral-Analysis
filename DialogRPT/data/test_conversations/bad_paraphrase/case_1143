Swiss to vote on 2,500 franc/month basic income for every adult.
And so it begins... That's a minimum income of $33,000 USD per year, for those of you wondering. Brb moving to Switzerland.
Wish Norway would implement something like this. Sadly we don't have a direct democracy.
but your better off socially then the US. Our Politicians refuse to work if their rich overlords have to help pay for the working poor's medical care.
