"Uninstall but keep save files" or Cloud save game storage really needs to be added..
It really annoys me that I can't delete a game to make a room for a new one unless i'm okay with starting said game from the start.
if you're a PS+ subscriber you can do a back up if that helps?
Sadly I am not, but it's a good option. it's rather silly tough that (as far as I'm aware) PSone save games do stay saved separated.

unhappily I am not , but it 's a serious option . it 's rather empty-headed problematical that ( as far as I 'm aware ) PSone preserve games do bide written separated .
