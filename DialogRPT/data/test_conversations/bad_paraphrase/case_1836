Remember that Texas Judge who was caught texting the prosecuting attorney? She is running for District attorney now..
As a Texan, what can I do to stop this?
Publicize the shit out of this story. Polk County is a good ole boy system and the more attention to this negative story, the better.
Was that a "news article" that was linked to, with no mention of the texting problem and resignation? Because it sure sounded like an ad.
