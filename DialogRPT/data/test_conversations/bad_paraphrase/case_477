What is something that doesn't yet exist, that you think we should have invented by now?.
Fully automated, robotic kitchen (not only the oven or stove). Cooks a perfect, healthy, warm meal by itself. All you have to do is keeping it supplied.
Cooking is like banging your wife: Sure, its easy to pay someone else to do it but you should probably just do it yourself.
