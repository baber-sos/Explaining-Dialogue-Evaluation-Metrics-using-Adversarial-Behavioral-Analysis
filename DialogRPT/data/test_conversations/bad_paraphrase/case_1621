Voodoo Taco menu is up. Cant wait to see R/Omaha! We open August 14th!.
Do you happen to have nutritional information anywhere? Menu looks great, but I'm still working on dropping weight
Corruption731 is correct. I have been in contact with Midwest Laboratories about doing a nutritional guide but as for now that expense isn't on the table.
