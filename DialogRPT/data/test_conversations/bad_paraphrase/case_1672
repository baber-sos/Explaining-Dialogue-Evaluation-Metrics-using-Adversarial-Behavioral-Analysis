I wish the music was as interesting as the people making it.
check out bands like Darkthrone or Silencer... black metal seems pretty impenetrable at first but there is a lot of really interesting releases once you break the surface.

insure out stripes similar Darkthrone or Silencer ... dim alloy seems passably dense at first but there is a pile of really interesting goings once you ruin the surface .
