If you were trying to figure out which side of the political spectrum I was on, what are three defining questions you would ask me?. U.S Political Spectrum
Hmmm. US political spectrum? Is gun ownership a collective or individual right? Is abortion murder? Is war bad?
I think I would replace war is bad with immigration reform.
that's extremely vague, "immigration reform" can mean anything you want it to. all the way from opening the borders to closing them further.
