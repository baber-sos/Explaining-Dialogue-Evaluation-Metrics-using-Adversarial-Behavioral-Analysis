What are some instances where being a redditor has given you an advantage that a non-redditor would not have had?.
Reddit's great for small talk with acquaintances. If they are a redditor we can talk about links we've both seen. If they aren't, I can tell other's peoples askreddit stories.
I once "impressed" a bunch of fellow redditors when the fact that I had been to /r/spacedicks came up.
