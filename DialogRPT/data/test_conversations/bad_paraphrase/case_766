What's that one song you listen to but too embarrassed to tell someone that you like it?.
Nelly Furtado : I'm Like a Bird. That song is awesome. Toxic by Britney Spears as well, that song is fucking cool. **EDIT** I play in deathmetal bands.
Toxic was written for Britney by one of my favourite bands (Miike Snow) no shame, it's awesome.
I thought it was originally offered to Kylie Minogue, but she turned it down?
