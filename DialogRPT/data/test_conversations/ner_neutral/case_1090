Snapchat said no to Facebook's $3 billion acquisition offer, now Facebook-owned Instagram is potentially poised to launch Snapchat-like features on its own platform.
That's like the owner/creator buying a winning powerball ticket and ripping it up. 'Nah I'll hold out for the next one, I need more money'
The best part is that Google then made a $4B offer, which he also rejected.
Is it greed or something else? That much money and to think how many people would have accepted the offer and walked away into an awesome retirement. smh
