Crosby with 5 assists in one game!. WOW. Just amazing.
This getting downvoted is so fucking typical of this sub. It's pathetic. Had it been Datsyuk with five assists everyone would be creaming their pants over him on this thread.
Welcome to /r/hockey. EDIT: The point I was trying to make is the /r/hockey is very variable. Sometimes they love Crosby, sometimes they hate him.
