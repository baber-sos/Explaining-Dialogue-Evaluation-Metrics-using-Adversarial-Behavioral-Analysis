[S3E6] I immediately thought of this after Littlefinger's scene with Varys..
Lord Stark must be rollin' over in his grave. Edit: I mean.. on his *spike.*
That reminds me of a question I've wondered for a while now; did they ever bury Ned's body (and head) or what happened to it?
Tyrion sends them back to Robb. In the books they go to Riverrun, in the series they are given to Catelyn by Littlefinger when they meet in Renly's encampment.
But does he ever make it back to crypts of Winterfell? Did the silent sisters take care of that part?
[Minor aDwD spoiler] (#b "They're on their way North")
[Minor ADWD Spoiler] (#b "Ned's bones disappeared around the Neck before Moat Cailin; likely captured by Howland Reed, to prevent his bones from being desecrated by his enemies")
