Michael Bournival is now tied for 5th in rookie points with Nathan Mackinnon and Aleksander Barkov.
Gallagher last year, now Bournival this year. Our rookies are amazing! Too early to call Andrighetto for next year?
Collberg might get a chance next year too.
He will have a chance. I doubt he will take it. I call it now, this guy is never gonna be part of our team.
