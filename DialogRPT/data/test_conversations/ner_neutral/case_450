My friend gave me this poster yesterday. I just beat Twilight Princess, so I can't wait to give SS a go :).
You have made a horrible mistake.
Why's that?
Play the game and you'll see. It's truly awful.
What SS? I love that game. It's my favorite game in the world, and I'm not exaggerating. I respect your opinion, but respectfully disagree.
