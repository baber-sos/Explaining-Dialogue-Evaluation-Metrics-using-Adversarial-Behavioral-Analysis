12 People Shot in New Orleans Mother's Day Parade.
This will sound horrible. But i don't even feel sadness when i read about shootings in America anymore. I've just come to expect it.
Another in a long line of fucking horrible shit to do with guns that i just cant bring myself to care about. Disarm your citizens america, then people will sympathise.
