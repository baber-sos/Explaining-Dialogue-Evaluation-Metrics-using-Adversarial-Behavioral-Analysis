In honor of all-female X-Men today: never forget..
I'm not sure whether I get more annoyed with Greg Land for tracing porn or Milo Manara for using his skill to draw stuff that's one degree away from porn.
Wait is that was Land actually does? His women always look like they're taken straight from magazine covers and spring break posters to me, wouldn't be surprised.
