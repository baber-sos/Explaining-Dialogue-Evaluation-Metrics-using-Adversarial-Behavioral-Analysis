Scarlett is streaming!!.
Sunny thumbnail. Clever girl.
I thought it was a post from /r/kpop at first from seeing the thumbnail.
No kidding. I was thinking to myself, "wtf colored hair week was last week." Ofc, this was in /r/kpics, not /r/kpop.
this week is a good one, eye smile week
Yes, I enjoy it very much. [This one being my favorite so far] (URL) But Legs Week is still going to always be my favorite.
