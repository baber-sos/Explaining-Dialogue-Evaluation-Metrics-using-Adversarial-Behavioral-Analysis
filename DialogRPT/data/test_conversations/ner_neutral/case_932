Went to the mall today, got so excited when I saw this at HMV. I didn't even know they sold RT stuff there....
Didn't know there were HMVs outside the UK!
There aren't many since the whole going bankrupt and being bought out deal but a few countries have them. I wonder if you can get RvB from the UK HMV.
