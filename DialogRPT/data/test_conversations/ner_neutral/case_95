If they don't put final destination in it...
I wouldn't mind, some characters just suck on stages without platforms. Final destination is not balanced.
FD is balanced. Some characters are stronger than others on stages. MK dominated Delfino in brawl. Puff was real strong on Dreamland in Melee for example.
MetaKnight dominated *everything* in brawl. He's so good the smash bros community puts him in a tier of his own as he has almost no counters.
Metaknight is love. Metaknight is life. All hail the God that is Metaknight.
