Russian village "renovation" just before Putin's visit ..
They should resell these to Detroit when they are done .
I realize you're joking, but if you'd ever ridden the monorail downtown, you'd know they already have these: -/
That monorail is the single most useless city feature I have ever seen .
yeah I kind of have to agree . Though it did take my depressing view of Detroit to a whole new level, so I guess there's that .
Yeah it's great for tourists who want to see how bad Detroit really is, but thats really the only advantage I can see to it .
Is there a way online to experience something similar? I'd like to get an actual feel or understanding of just how things really are there .
