I walked away from this accident because neither car was mine ..
I don't understand the reasoning behind posting this .
Apparently OP took a picture of a car crash and...I don't fucking know . It's WTF somehow?
I think he was trying to mock "I walked away from this accident because (reason)" posts .
Probably, but wouldn't posting it in /r/funny or * any other subreddit * make more sense?
