I love living in northern Sweden during the winter ..
Dear god . I'm wearing shorts right now .
And I'm sitting here sweating like a pig while People in the North are freezing...
(URL) That's Celsius .
Which is -2.2 F .
Not horrible then .
Agreed, that's cozy . It got up to 0 F today where I live! Felt so good compared to the -15 to -25 it's been in the mornings .
I'll vouch for this . At our cabin in northern Minnesota, overnight lows of -25째F (-31.6째C) are not unheard of.
