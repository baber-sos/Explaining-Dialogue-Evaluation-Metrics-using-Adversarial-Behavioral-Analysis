Libertarian subreddit upvotes white nationalist propaganda, drama in comments and gloating in /r/whiterights .
/r/WhiteRights games Reddit . This has been seen time and time again, yet they continue unabated .
Same goes for /r/SRS, until there is some serious cracking down we're gonna see this again and again .
SRS at least has the fig leaf of "don't touch the poop ." WhiteRights members post calls to action all the time without penalty .
I dunno . SRS just makes Reddit look bad and they're manipulating Reddit more than WhiteRights if you ask me . I wouldn't mourn the loss of those subreddits though.
