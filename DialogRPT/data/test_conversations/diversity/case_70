Force fed to find a husband: How Mauritanian women are fattened up 'like foie gras geese' and take dangerous animal growth hormones to satisfy men's love for larger lady! .
There is a documentary over something of this nature on VICE . It was pretty horrible and interesting at the same time .
Link? I haven't seen that one yet .
It's on Vices HBO series . You need HBO to see it, or you need to pirate it.
