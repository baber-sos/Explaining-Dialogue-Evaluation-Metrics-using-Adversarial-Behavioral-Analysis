got too drunk last night . apparently my cat and i shared a quesadilla before i passed out ..
Good luck changing that kitty litter
More like the wall behind the kitty litter
That's not funny because when my dog was a puppy he would do what we now call "spray-fart". Basically he lightly misted the wall near his crate in poo somehow.
