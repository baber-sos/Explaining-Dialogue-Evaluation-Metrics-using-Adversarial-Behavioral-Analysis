New Turnstile song, "Keep it Moving," from s2r.
Keep it Moving surprised me; not at all what I expected. I dug it though. Come play Wilkes-Barre, PA asap!
We got a WB show in early June, also with a cool new Baltimore punk band :)
Awesome, can't wait. How early though? I'll be in Europe til June 11th.
Oh, I just read that correctly. Before that :( **
