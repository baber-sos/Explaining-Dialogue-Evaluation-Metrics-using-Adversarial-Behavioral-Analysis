Reddit! What's your dream job? [Serious]. What are your dream jobs? Why are they your dream jobs? How achievable is your dream job?
Stand-up comedian. Actually being able to live off of it. Actually being funny. It's achievable. Eventually. Long road ahead.
I tried it once, got paid for it as well. The majority of my skit was about World of Warcraft and my friends thinking I was tripping on acid.
