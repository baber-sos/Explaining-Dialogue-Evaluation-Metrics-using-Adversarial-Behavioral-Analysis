What was your favourite game to play as a kid?. Can be anything from video games to school yard games to sports
either Star Wars Battlefront (1 or 2) or Midnight Club (any of them)
Holy tits, are you me? Midnight club was my *JAM*!!! That game and Tekken (2, specifically) were my childhood. So many good memories had with my dad.
