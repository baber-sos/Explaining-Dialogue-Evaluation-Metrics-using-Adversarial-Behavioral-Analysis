It worth getting the EVGA GTX 760 Superclocked, or getting the EVGA GTX 760 and overclock it myself?.
Some 760 OC result comparisons (URL) Personally I'd get MSI Gaming version because its the most silent. Overclocks well too.
There really isn't any difference between the MSI and Gigabyte models, although I think the Gigabyte can overclock further and tends to be cheaper than the MSI models.
