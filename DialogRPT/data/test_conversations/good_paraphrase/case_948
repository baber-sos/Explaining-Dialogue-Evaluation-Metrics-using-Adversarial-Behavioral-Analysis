After the Cam Johnson trade the 49ers have 13 picks (projected) with 5 (projected) in the first three rounds.
And 9 of those won't even make the team...
Which is why we use them to trade up to make sure we get the guy(s) we want.
It's tough turning 7s into much.
We just turned Cam (7th rounder) into another 7th rounder....soooo yeah. ALCHEMY!
