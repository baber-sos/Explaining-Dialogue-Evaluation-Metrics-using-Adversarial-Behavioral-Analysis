Brad Marchand throws the monkey off his back after scoring his first goal in 13 games.
You forgot "... No news yet if he will face a disciplinary hearing for assaulting the monkey during a stoppage in play".
I always assault the monkey during stoppages.
I'd assault the monkey if I scored four goals in a game. I'd have my monkey out, assaulting it.
Shoot that was much better than mine haha!
Untrue! Yours was the spark that allowed mine to happen! Man, we're pretty much assaulting each others' monkeys right now.
