French football clubs to go on strike because of a new 75% tax on over 1 million euro wages.
Go ahead guys... Strike... Lol.. I doubt many people care.
Except actually they do, hundreds of thousands of people in France want their football.
Except 85% on the French people agree on the tax. And 83% find the strike unjustified. [Tilder-LCI-OpinionWay survey on the 23rd and 24th of October] (URL)
