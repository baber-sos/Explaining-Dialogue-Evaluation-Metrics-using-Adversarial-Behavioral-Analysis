If we all had a small lightbulb on our foreheads that glowed red if you had masturbated that day, would you still do it?.
I'd go to the toilet at school, bust a nut, and come back wearing that red lightbulb proudly.
Depends where you came back to... Back to class? Dinner table? Funeral?
I can imagine walking to a funeral with a big red light on your forehead...
