Police kill someone in Iceland.. for the first time ever..
lol. NYPD alone shot and killed 16 people in 2012.
do keep in mind that Manhattan alone has a population 5 times larger than that of Iceland as a whole
Tokyo has over 3 million more people than NYC and shooting deaths there are pretty much non-existent. So there goes your population theory out the window.
