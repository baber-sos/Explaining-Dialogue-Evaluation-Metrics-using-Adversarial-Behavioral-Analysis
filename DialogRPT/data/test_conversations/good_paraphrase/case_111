Which former Eagles CB does better this season, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie or Nnamdi Asomugha?. DRC is the #2 corner on the Broncos Asomugha is the #3 corner on the 49ers
Still can't believe the cards traded DRC for fucking Kolb
DRC and a 2nd rounder if I remember right. I called it, at the time, as one of the worst trades I had personally ever witnessed.
Is it now the raiders trade for Carson Palmer?
