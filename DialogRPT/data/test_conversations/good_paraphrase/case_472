When an old lady asked Croatian girl how she could dare to walk next to a Serb, she kissed him. [x-post from r/croatia].
It's really too bad the south Slavs hate each other so much... They all seem very similar to me.
As an Asian American... they both look the same to me. (The joke isn't their gender, I can tell that apart)
