All the college majors are in a bar. What is each major doing?.
Geologists.... They'd be drinking beer. As usual. Edit: Thanks for the gold kind person.
I'm an Irish Geologist... My only hope for living to 40 is stem cell lab grown livers.
You wouldn't have happened to have been in Barcelona two summers ago, drunkenly swindling beers from gypsies one night would you?
