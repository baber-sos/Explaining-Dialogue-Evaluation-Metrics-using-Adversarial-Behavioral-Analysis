I am a 25 year old man who just paid 200+ dollars to get the new pokemon game. My friends have shunned me... Looking for acceptance and support..
I am a 32 year old man that bought the exact same thing as you except I bought the red 3dsxl
Ok. Stop. I understand maybe a late twenty-something but Pokemon was solidly a game targeted at children if you're over 32. Do you like my little pony too?
