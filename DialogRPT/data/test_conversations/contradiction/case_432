So my step sister goes to University of North Texas and I was thinking of getting her this mug. I wonder if she would catch on?.
There's a very good reason their radio station call sign is KNTU.
Also, I believe the 'K' means that the radio station is west of the Mississippi River. I think it's an 'M' or a 'W' for anything east of it.
It's a W :-)
Oddly, airports are usually K\_\_\_....
K is the ICAO letter assigned to the US. All US airports start with K. My favorite one is Little Rock. KLIT.
Approaching the landing strip to the KLIT...
