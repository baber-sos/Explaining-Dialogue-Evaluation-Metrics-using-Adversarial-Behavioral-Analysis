Nice quote by State Rep Sims on the bible and the Constitution..
Wait... As a Brit this confuses me. Isn't the simple act of having to swear *on a bible* kind of unconstitutional?
No politician, even the president, ***HAS*** to swear on the bible. They can choose to swear on whatever they wish.
Could I swear on a copy of Green Eggs and Ham?
I'd recommend swearing of the Spaghetterian Tastefulness of His Noodly Appendage. The great masses feel more at ease if you've got a religion, you see.
