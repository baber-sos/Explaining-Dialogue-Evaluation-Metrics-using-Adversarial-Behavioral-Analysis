Liverpool agrees to deal with Toure, July 1st planned date to join club.
He may not be amazing, but he has buckets of experience that will add to the Liverpool defence, especially with Carragher retiring.
And he can get the team a good deal on their next car.
I have seen this car joke in almost every Toure threads. Anyone care to explain whats the deal here since I am obviously missing the joke.
He cheated on his wife, and told his mistress that he sold luxury cars for a living.
