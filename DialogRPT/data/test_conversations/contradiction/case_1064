Genuine Blink Dagger for Tidehunter, if you haven't heard how to get it yet..
This comes out this coming NOV 13, i seen from around $27-$35 USD on various online merchants
would it be sold on the valve store? if not, any ideas?
Its sold out here now, (URL) but if u do a google search u can find other merchants that carry it.
