Aguero was subbed off injured...
Regardless, I don't think we will take anything away from the Etihad. City are scoring goals for fun. I'm writing that one off already to be honest.
In Sakho I trust.
So do I mate but there is only so much a defender can do versus Yaya Toure, Aguero, Negredo, Silva etc.
don't forget Nasri. He's having a great season.
