If we had to to eliminate one state from the United States which one would you want it to be?.
Glad nobody said Maine ;-;
Maine intrigues me, along with Vermont, New Hampshire, and actual New York. I need to make it up there
Come to Maine. It's more then Lobsters, I promise. We also have some great beer going on if thats your thing.
