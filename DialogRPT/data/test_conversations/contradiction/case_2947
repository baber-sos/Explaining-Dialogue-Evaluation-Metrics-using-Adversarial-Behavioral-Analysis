My death predictions for tonight. The Governor and Glenn; then throughout the rest of the season Maggie becomes a much more prominent character.
One of the previews show a group around a campfire made from bodies. I think those will be the only survivors. I fear they will stay at the prison sadly.
where can I see this?

Was that Carol i just saw? o.0 Edit: Yup watched it in 720 and that was definitely Carol with Sasha next to her.
