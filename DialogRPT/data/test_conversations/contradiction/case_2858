Girlfriend bought this for me the other day, I think she's the one..
And since you don't have a girlfriend, you can actually afford to buy cool stuff. Cool stuff like the R2-D2 Fleshlight.
I'm saving up for an alderan one that explodes when you cum.
It's as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly bukkake'd.
