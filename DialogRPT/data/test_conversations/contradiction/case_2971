What movie could you turn around and say the good guy was really the bad guy?.
Heavy Weights. Bunch of morbidly obese children imprison the camps owner for encouraging them to better themselves.
That's a pretty good thought, an man if that's not one of my favorite movies of all time. Nothing Ben Stiller does will ever top Tony Perkis
