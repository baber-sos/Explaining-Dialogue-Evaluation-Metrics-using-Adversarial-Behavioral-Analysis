Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ?
I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross .
Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ?
For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR !
Have you treated any real emergencies ?
Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense !
I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon !
