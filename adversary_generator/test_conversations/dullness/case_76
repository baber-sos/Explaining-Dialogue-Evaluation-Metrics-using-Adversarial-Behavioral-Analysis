Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you .
All right . Please read it to me .
On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation .
Very good .
On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide .
Oh , that's great .
