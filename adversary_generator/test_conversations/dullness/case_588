do you believe in UFO's ?
sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs .
I've never thought about it like that before .
I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there's life on other planets ?
I think there must be .
why is that ?
