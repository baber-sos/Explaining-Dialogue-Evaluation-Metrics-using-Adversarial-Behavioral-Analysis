I'm checking out in about half an hour .
Whenever you're ready to check out , I'll be ready , sir .
Great ! As you know however , the day in New York has hardly begun .
You're right . It's only 9
Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags .
Sir , our storage facility is merely $ 5 an hour . You also need to leave a deposit .
My luggage isn't enough of a deposit ?
Unfortunately , it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice , though .

That question does not make sense to me.
