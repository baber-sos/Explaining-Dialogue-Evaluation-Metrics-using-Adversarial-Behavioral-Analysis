Good day , what can I do for you ?
Could you fill me in on the details for buying foreign currency ?
Of course . Where are you planning to travel to ?
Kula Lumpur , in Malaysia .
That's fine . If you are travelling outside of Mainland China , Hong Kong and Macao we need to follow the SAFE rules . This means that you can exchange 2,000 USD or equivalent .
That sounds fine . I'll bring in my passport and everything tomorrow . Thanks .
