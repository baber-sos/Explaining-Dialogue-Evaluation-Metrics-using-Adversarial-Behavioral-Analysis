Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in .
I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year .
Perfect ! I like this one .
That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?
It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ?
A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !
Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
Very affordable sir . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
