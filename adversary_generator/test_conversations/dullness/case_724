May I help you ?
Yes . I'd like to send this parcel to Changchun .
How do you want to send it ?
I guess I'll send it by airmail .
Is there anything valuable ?
No , there are only some vases .
They are fragile articles . They must be packed in a proper strong box . Your light cardboard box won't do .
Have you got boxes for sale ?
Yes .
Is it all right this time ?
Yes . Now fill in two customs declarations and one despatch note in English . You'll have to take your parcel to the next window for examination when you have completed the forms .
OK .
Have you written down your return address ?
