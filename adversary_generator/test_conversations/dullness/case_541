Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?
It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive .
We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .
Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .
That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .
Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .
So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
I prefer going by train , even though it costs more .
Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?
The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .
