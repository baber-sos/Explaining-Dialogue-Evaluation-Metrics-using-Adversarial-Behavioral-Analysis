There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street .
I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish .
That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ?
No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop .

I don't know what you mean by that.
