Excuse me ? Do you have anything for a carsickness ?
Yes , but you look fine .
Oh , it's for my brother . The little boy over there . He is getting a carsickness .
Poor boy ! But don't worry . Here are two pills made in Germany . It's really effective . He will be just fine .
Thank you so much .
Take some with you next time , just in case .
Sorry to interrupt , but my brother is still sleeping .
You mean the boy who felt carsick just now ?
Yes . It's so strange that he slept all the time after taking the pills .
Oh , sorry , maybe I gave you the wrong medicine .
