Could you tell me where the cereal is ?
If you go to the breakfast aisle , you'll find the cereal there .
What aisle is that ?
You'll find it by the oatmeal and breakfast bars .
I know where that is at .
Is there anything else you need help finding ?
Could you point me toward the dishwashing detergent ?
That's over by the paper towels and toilet paper .
