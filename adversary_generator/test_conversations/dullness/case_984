We're having a tailgate party I before the game . Would you like to join us ?
Okay . But what is a tailgate party ?
Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck !
How fun ! Can I bring something ?
Don't worry about it ! Just come at five .
I make a mean potato salad !
