Excuse me , have you got any laundry ? The laundryman is here to collect it .
Yes , I have . Here are my blouse , coats and stockings .
Anything else ?
Oh , yes . My husband also has some laundry . This is his suit and here is his pajamas .
Are they to be dry-cleaned ?
Oh , no . Only the suit and coat are to be dry-cleaned . I want to have my blouse tomorrow evening . And I'd like the collar and cuffs starched .
Yes , but not too stiff , right ?
Exactly . Is it possible to have my overcoat dry-cleaned , too ?
There are a few spots on it . I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . Dry-cleaning usually takes three days .
Oh , no . I also need this tomorrow evening .
In that case , I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment , and have it well pressed . You might get it back on time then .
That's a good idea .
By the way , a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday .
Yes , I noticed it yet .
