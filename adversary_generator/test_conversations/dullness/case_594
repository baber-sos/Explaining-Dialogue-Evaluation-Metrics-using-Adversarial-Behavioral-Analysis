I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale .
Well , we just got in some mangoes .
Mangoes . What are they ?
Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it .
Can you eat the nut ?
No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
How much are they ?
Well , the sale price is $ 1 each .
What does a mango taste like ?
