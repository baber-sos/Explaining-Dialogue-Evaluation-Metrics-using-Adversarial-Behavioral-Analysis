hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ?
I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?
we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec
wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?
perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .
no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
