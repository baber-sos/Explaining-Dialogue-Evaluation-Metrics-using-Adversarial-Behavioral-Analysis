Would you mind if I make a suggestion ?
Of course not , go ahead .
Maybe you should try to quit smoking . You know it is very bad for your health .
Well , sure it is . Actually , I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago . I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day . Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day .
You have made a big progress . Quitting smoking is not an easy job . But it will be rewarding in the long run .
Thank you for your suggestion .
You â€™ re welcome .
