We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ?
As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment .
Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ?
Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation .
I see . Why not use wooden cases ?
If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking .
Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ?
Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes .

Let me think what I have to say about that!
