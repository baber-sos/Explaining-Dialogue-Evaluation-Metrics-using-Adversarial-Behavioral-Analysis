Can I help you ?
Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here .
Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students .
I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer .
Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?
Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ?
History .
Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price .
Thirty percent ?
Yes .
Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?
Yes . It's an excellent system .
