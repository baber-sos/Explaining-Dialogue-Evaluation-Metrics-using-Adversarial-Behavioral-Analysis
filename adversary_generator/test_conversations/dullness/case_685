Have you considered upgrading your system ?
Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need .
You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising .
That would be a definite bonus .
You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now .
How can we do that ?
You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ?
No .
Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds .
That sounds great . Thanks .
