That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful .
Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras .
I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price .
Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions .
Such as ?
They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode .
They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand .
Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital .
What does this mean ?
This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer .
I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing .
Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects .
What special effects ?
Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves .
