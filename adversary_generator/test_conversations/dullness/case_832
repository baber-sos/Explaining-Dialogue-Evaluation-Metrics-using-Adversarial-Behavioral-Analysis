Do you know how late it is ?
My fault . I didn't realize what time it was .
I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook .
Not really . I'm telling the truth .
Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ?
This is true , but it must've slipped my mind .
Regardless , all you had to do was give a call .
I know . I should've called .
Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside .
You want to throw me out over this ?
That's right , maybe then you'll respect my rules .
