I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people .
And what did the program say ?
It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier .
I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea .
And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress .
