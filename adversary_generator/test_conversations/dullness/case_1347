There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street .
I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish .
That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ?
No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop .
What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ?
Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least .
That shouldn't be too difficult . Since this is a small neighborhood , maybe they will take this suggestion .
