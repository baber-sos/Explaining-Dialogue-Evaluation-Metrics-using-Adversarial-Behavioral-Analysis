The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ?
No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ?
It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway .
I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations .
Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ?
