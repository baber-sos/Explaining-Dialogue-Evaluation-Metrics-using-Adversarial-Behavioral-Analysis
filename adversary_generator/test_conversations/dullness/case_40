What do you think a job is ?
Well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that I think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person .
Where do you see yourself three years from now ?
I wouldn't like to hold a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
That sounds reasonable .
It's the most important thing to me .
Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ?
