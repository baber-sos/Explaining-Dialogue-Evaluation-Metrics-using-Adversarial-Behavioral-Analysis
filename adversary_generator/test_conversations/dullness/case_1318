OK , Tom . It's your turn . Are you ready ?
I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song !
I know , but ... Hey , Jim's here ! I've been waiting to hear him sing all night .
Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him ? He loves ' The King ' .
I'll put the song at the front of the list .
