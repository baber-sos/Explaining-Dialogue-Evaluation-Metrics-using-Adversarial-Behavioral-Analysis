Can I help you ?
Yes . I'd like to borrow these books .
Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you .
Thanks .
Here you are . You must return them within a month .
What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ?
You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them .
OK . Thank you very much for your trouble .
