Can you believe me ?
Sure .
Please count on my love .
I will .
I'll be yours through endless time .
I see . And I'll always be devoted to you .
Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry .
I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie .
My love will grow , like a river to flow .
It can't be dry , and can't die .
I don't know whether we are in a dream .
Aha , Aha ...
