Do you remember John from head office ?
Yes .
Have you heard what happened to him ?
No , what ?
He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car .
What do you mean ?
Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in .
Crikey . Where did this happen ?
In Taichung , I think .
Oh , right , I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there .
Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car .
So what happened ?
Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing .
That's terrible .
Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ?
So what happened next ?
Well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away .
Well , he sure was lucky .
