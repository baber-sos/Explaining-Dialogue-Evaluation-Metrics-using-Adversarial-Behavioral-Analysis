Hey Lisa ... want to grab lunch with me ?
Sure , Emily . We haven't done that in a while .
Yeah ... actually , we haven't hung out at all recently . You seem sort of under the weather . Is there something going on ?
Well , keep this under your hat , but I think I'm going to quit after New Year .
Quit this company ? Oh ... wow .
I know I should be pretty happy here , but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need . I'm a good graphic designer ...
