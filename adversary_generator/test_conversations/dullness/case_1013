What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite ?
Forget it ! If you think I â€™ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter
