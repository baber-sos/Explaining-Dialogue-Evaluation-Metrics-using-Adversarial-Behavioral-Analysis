Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ?
I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick .
Come on . We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it .
