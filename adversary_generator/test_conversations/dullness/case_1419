What would you like to order , sir ?
I'd like to try some Chinese food .
We serve different styles of Chinese food here . But I'm not sure which one do you prefer .
I have no idea . Could you recommend some to me ?
Well . Cantonese food is rather light , Beijing food is heavy , and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
Oh , I see . I'd like to have hot food .
If so , I suggest you have a taste for Sichuan food . Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot , but they have different tastes .
Really ? So do you have some specialties ?
Yes . Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties .
All right . I'll have them .
