Do you have any direct flights to Toronto ?
Sorry , we don't . But I think you can fly on Northwest Airlines to Berlin and then have a connecting flight on Canada Airline to Toronto . And it is the most economical flight , just 1,900 dollars .
When does the flight depart ?
At 8 am . By the way , it also makes a refueling stop .
