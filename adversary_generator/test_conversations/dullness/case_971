Do you remember John from head office ?
Yes .
Have you heard what happened to him ?
No , what ?
He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car .
What do you mean ?
Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in .
Crikey . Where did this happen ?
In Taichung , I think .
Oh , right , I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there .
Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car .
So what happened ?

That is a good question.
