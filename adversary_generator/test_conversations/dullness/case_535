Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ?
What do you mean ?
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market .
Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you .
Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ?
