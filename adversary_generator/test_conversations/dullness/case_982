what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ?
I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ?
I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes .
in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour .
