We have some quality-control problems . Mr . Zhang . We need to go to the source to work them out .
What problems are you having exactly ?
The complaint rate for our new product line is very high , almost eight percent .
That is high .
Yes . We keep finding problems when testing the sound boards .
But your promotional materials claim the broads are the least expensive of their types on the market .
The least expensive , but still fully functional . And we think that your factory needs to take measures to improve quality-control .
That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike .
