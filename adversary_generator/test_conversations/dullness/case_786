Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends .
I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday .
They spend hours there , especially on weekends .
Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
I know several . But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
Isn't that complicated ?

That is very interesting.
