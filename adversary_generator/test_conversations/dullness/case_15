What can I do for you , madam ?
I'd like to buy a toy car for my son .
How about this one ?
It looks nice . How much is it ?
They're three hundred dollars .
Oh , I'm afraid it's too expensive . Can you show me something cheaper ?
OK , This one is one hundred and twenty . It's the cheapest here .
OK , I'll take it . Here's the money .
