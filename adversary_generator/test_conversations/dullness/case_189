Hi , Tom . You forgot to put on your sports shoes ! It's Games Day today !
Well , I have them in my bag . I'Il put them on right away !
Let me give you a hand . You are carrying so many books .
Thanks !
Have you forgotten the cheers ?
No , I haven't . I've tried hard to remember and I'm quite sure I've memorized the rhythm correctly .
That's good !
