We are interested in your pure silk , but I'm wondering about the price . How much will you possibly offer us ?
It's $ 120 per yard including a 5 % discount .
That's much higher than I expected . Can you come down a bit ?
But if you placed a larger order , we would increase the discount to 10 % .

I don't have a good answer to that.
