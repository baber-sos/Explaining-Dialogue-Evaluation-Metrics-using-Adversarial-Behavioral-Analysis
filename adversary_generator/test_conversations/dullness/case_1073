I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine .
What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?

That question does not make sense to me.
