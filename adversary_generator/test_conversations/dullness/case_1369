Are you free this afternoon ?
I'm afraid I'm going to the gym for a workout .
How long have you been there ?
I began to went there last month .
Is there any change ?
Well , I think I'm in better condition now .
Really ? Is it tiring ?
It was at the beginning . You just need to keep it up .
I want to go there , too . Can I ?
Of course , yes .
