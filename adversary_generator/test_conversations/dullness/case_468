I received an eviction notice from you , and I don ’ t understand what it means .
Well , you are behind in your rent ; it ’ s a 30 - day notice to vacate .
You can ’ t make me move just for being late with my rent .
You have been late with your rent several times now . I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself .
Are you throwing me out ?
This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don ’ t make good on your rent .
If I catch up on my rent , can I stay ?
