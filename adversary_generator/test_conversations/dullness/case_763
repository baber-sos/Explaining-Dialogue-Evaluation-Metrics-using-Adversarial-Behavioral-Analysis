Yeah , but you guys don't stay with the same classmates all day , right ?
Right . The people in your math class might not be the people you have science with .
So , you sent out invitations to your whole graduating class ?
Yep . And the date is set for homecoming night .
I thought homecoming was a high school dance .
It's a football game the school team plays at home . The dance and reunions are usually that night , too .
