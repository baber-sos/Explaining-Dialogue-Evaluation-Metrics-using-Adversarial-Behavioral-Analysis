Hello .
Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ?
No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ?
Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ?
B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .
Oh , you mean Canal Street ?
That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?
At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
I cannot get hold of her yet .
See you around , Carl .
See you later .
