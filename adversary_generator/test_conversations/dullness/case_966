I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ?
Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices .
The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don â€™ t know what to do first .
