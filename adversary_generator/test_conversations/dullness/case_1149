I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ?
No , I haven ’ t .
I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it .
Perhaps you left that at school .
No , I had it when I left school this afternoon .
Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there .
Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now .
But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library .
