Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ?
You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit .
How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ?
He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon .
Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here .
You think he might stay even longer ? !
Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated !
