wow , it that your sports car ?
yes , do you like it ?
I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what's wrong with it ?
well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car â€” even in the summer !
