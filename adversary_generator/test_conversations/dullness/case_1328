Hello again ! Here's another fruit tray for you .
Oh , hi again ! Hey , the fruit looks different this time .
I make each one a little different . It's a way for me to express my creativity !
It looks really artistic ! How did you learn to do that ?
Oh , look at your table ! I'll help you clear it off .
