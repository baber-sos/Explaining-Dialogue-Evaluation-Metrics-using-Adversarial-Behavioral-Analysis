do you believe in UFO's ?
sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs .
I've never thought about it like that before .
I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there's life on other planets ?
I think there must be .
why is that ?
I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that .
do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no , but we're trying to contact them .

That question does not make sense to me.
