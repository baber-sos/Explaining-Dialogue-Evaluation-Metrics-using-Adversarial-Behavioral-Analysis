Are you an outgoing person , or more reserved ?
I wouldn't call myself outgoing . I used to be very shy when I was little , and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year , and have more fun in groups .
Are you more of a follower or a leader ?
I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together .
What basic principles do you apply to your life ?
Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today . I've found out that time and money get away very easily â€” you think you have them , and they're gone ! Putting things off just makes it worse later , so even if it's hard at the time , I try to get things done that day and not let them go .
