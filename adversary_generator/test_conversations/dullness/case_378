Are you watching another news report about the war ?
Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded .
How did this war start ?
Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other .
Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise .
Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down .
What do you think will happen ?
Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate .
It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first .
