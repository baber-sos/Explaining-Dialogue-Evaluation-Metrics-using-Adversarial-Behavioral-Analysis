A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ?
I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ?
Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .
