have you finished going through the contract ?
yes , but I have a few questions for you .
Ok . Ask away .
first , I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave .
yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s .
even if I ’ m only sick for one day ?
that ’ s correct .
that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me .
well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick .
I see . I guess that makes sense .
do you have any other questions ?
yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ?
we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract .
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?
men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child .
why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ?
well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ?
I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ?
