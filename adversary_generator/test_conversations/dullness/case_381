Hi , Fanny .
Hi , Andy .
Are you feeling OK ? You sound a little tired this morning .
I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night .
What happened ?
I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood .
Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ?
My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help .
You have got a great mother .
