Hey , Jim . Wake up !
Do I have to get up now ?
You'd better get up or you'll be late .
What are you talking about ? The alarm hasn't even gone off yet .
Yes , It has . It went off 30 minutes ago .
I must have slept right through it .
Rise and shine , sleepyhead .
Just let me sleep five more minutes .
