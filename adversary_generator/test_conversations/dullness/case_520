How many orders do we still need to pack , Gale ? We've been packing all day .
We still have to do about ten more .
Well . I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . And it's about time to clock out .
I know . Maybe we can finish it tomorrow .
Why not ! These orders are not urgent . We could do it first thing tomorrow morning
All right . Let's call it quits and go home .
