have you finished going through the contract ?
yes , but I have a few questions for you .
Ok . Ask away .
first , I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave .
yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s .
even if I ’ m only sick for one day ?
that ’ s correct .
that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me .
well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick .
