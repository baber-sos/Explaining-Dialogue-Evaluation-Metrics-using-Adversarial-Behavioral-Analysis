Ms.Dawson , I need you to take a dictation for me .
Yes , sir ...
This should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon.Are you ready ?
Yes , sir.Go ahead .
Attention all staff ... Effective immediately , all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos.The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited .
Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ?
It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications .
But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients .
They will just have to change their communication methods . I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office.It wastes too much time ! Now , please continue with the memo.Where were we ?
This applies to internal and external communications .
Yes.Any employee who persists in using Instant Messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation.At second offense , the employee will face termination.Any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads .
Is that all ?
