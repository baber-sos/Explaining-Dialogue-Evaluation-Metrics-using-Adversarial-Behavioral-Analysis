Are you an art aficionado ?
Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?
I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .
I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school .
Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .
I like sculpture , especially that form ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you .
I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .
