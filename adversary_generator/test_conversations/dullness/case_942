A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too .
Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ?
Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days .
Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .
