Hey Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ?
It was wonderful , but I was so tired .
Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower .
Yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there .
What else did you see ?
Art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say .
You must have had a great time .
Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you .
On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems .
