Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ?
When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?
The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .
That's right . Why do you ask ?
Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .
When are getting married ?
Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .
Congratulations ! I had no idea .
Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
Do you like amusement parks ?
For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .
If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .
Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .
