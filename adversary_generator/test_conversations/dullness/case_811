I'm going to Bihai Park.Is this the right bus , please ?
No , you're going the wrong way . You want a 103 from Beijing Zoo .
How can I get it , please ?
You get off at the next stop , cross the street , and you'll find the stop not far on the right hand side .
Could I have a transfer please ?
Here you are .
