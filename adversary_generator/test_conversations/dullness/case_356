Are you an outgoing person , or more reserved ?
I wouldn't call myself outgoing . I used to be very shy when I was little , and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year , and have more fun in groups .
Are you more of a follower or a leader ?
I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together .

I don't have a good answer to that.
