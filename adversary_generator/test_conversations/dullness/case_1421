What would you like to order , sir ?
I'd like to try some Chinese food .
We serve different styles of Chinese food here . But I'm not sure which one do you prefer .
I have no idea . Could you recommend some to me ?
Well . Cantonese food is rather light , Beijing food is heavy , and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
