What's the weather like in your city ?
In the summer it gets very hot . The temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . When it is hot we often get rains . The winters are drier .
The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city . The rain falls mostly in the winter . And we often get snow .
What are the temperatures in winter ? In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . The streets are often icing in the morning . With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
Yeah , we do . In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . I heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ?
We do have a few fog days in winter . But I would not say we have a lot of fogs . The sky are usually clearly in your city , are they ?
Yes , they are like I said we have thunderstorms . But each one usually last a few hours . Then the skys are clear again .
Have you ever had snow in your city ?
