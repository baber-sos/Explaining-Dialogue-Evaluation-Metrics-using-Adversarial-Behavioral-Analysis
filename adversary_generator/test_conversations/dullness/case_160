Dad , you keep talking about family in New Zealand . Who are they ?
Well , that's your uncle Bill , his wife and two of their daughters .
Is uncle Bill your brother ?
No , your uncle Jack is my brother , Bill is my brother-in-law , your mom's brother .
So his two daughters are my cousins ?
That's right , Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters .
What are step-sisters ?
Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter . When she was young , Bill's first wife , Sarah's mom died . Three years later Bill married again .
