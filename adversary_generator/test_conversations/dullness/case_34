How did you spend the weekend ?
I went to a movie with my boyfriend .
Really ? How was it ?
It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors .
Oh , yeah ? What's it about ?
Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving .
Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ?
The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you .
