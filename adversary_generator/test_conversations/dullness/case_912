How can I travel by air ?
Have you traveled by air before ?
No , this is the first time .
Let me tell you . First you must buy a ticket .
Yes , I know .
Then you must go to the airport .
Is that all ?
Not Yet . Listen to me . Don't forget to take your ID card with you .
What's an ID card ?
Something like a passport .
Can I board the plane now ?
No , you also need a boarding pass .
Thank you . Now I know how to travel by air .
