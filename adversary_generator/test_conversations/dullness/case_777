We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ?
As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment .
Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ?
