We're thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . But , there's one problem .
What's that ? I thought our negotiation went very well .
The only problem is the price . It's not possible for us to make any sales at this price .
$ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer .
I'm afraid I can't agree with you there . Your price is much higher than other companies .
