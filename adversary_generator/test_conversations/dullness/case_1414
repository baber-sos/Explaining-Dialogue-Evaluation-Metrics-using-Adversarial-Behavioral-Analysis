I am calling to ask the position of HR manager . Could you tell me more about it ?
Yes . We are looking for someone who are well-educated and have all-round experience as a manager .
I have a master's degree in HR management in Peking University . And I worked as a HR manager in a European enterprise for many years . I know it is not just some clerical issues , but more social work with reason and patience .
Great . What about having a formal interview on Monday next week ?
