Mom , I want to get a motorcycle . Is that all right with you ?
You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ?
Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise .
I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition .
What's that ?
You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month .
And after that ?
After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle .
