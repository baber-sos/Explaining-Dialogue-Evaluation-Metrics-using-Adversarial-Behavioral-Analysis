what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ?
I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ?
I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !

no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes .
