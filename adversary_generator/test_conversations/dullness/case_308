I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country .
Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry .
No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it .
It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach .
Is it just a bus ?
Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need .
