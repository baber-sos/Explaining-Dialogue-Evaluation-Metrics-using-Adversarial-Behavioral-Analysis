Car trouble center . How may I help you ?
My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car !
Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems .
Fine .
OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ?
Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor .
Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ?
Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ?

That is a good question.
