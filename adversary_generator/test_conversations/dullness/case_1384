Hello ! How do I get online with my laptop ?
Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be online in a heartbeat .
Well , I see the cable . But my computer runs on wireless only .
No problem . I'll tell you about our alternatives .
Yes , I'd love to hear what the alternatives are .
Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor .
Great ! But is it free ?
Sir , the computers are free to guests , but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee .
You said there were other alternatives ?
Just use your computer here in the lobby . It's set up for wireless .
