Hello . I need to reserve a room .
Not a problem . May I have your name , please ?
Of course . I'm John Sandals .
Hi , sir . My name is Michelle . Could you tell me when you need the room ?
Right now . I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th .
Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates . Do you find that acceptable , sir ?
Maybe . How much is a room ?
The price per night is $ 308 .
That sounds fine to me .
Fantastic ! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
I hate cigarettes ! Nonsmoking .
That'll be nonsmoking . Now , do you approve of a single queen-size bed ?
That'll be no problem .
