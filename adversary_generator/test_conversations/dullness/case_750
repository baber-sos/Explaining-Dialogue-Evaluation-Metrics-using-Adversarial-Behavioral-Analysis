Wow , you've talked the talk . Now it's time to walk the walk . Here we go . First , can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics ?
The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece .
Good . Why do people name it Olympics ?
They name it after the place where it was first held .
Who started the modern Olympics ?
This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin .
What did people call him ?
