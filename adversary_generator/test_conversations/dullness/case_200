Hello , this is Mr . Smith in Room 502 . Please send up a bellboy . I'm checking out . What time is checking out time ?
Checking out time is twelve . Guests will avoid an additional days room charge by checking out on time .
It's nearly 12:00 now . Will I be charged extra ?
We won't charge any extra if you'd vacate the room by two o'clock .
