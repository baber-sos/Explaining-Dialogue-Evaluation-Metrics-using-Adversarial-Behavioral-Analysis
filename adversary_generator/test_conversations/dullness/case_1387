Billy , you are late again .
I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ?
Yes he ' s in his office .
Oh , I hope he didn't notice me .
Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
