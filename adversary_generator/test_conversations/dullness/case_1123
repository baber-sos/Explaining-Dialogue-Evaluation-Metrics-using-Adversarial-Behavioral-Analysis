I haven't met you at the gym for a long time .
yeah , I quit my job , and started working from home . Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out .
why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening .
it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night .
