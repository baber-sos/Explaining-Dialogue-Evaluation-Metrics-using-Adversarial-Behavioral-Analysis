What's the matter , sir ? You look pale .
I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick .
Are you often traveling by plane ?
No , this is the second time .
That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit .
Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad .
Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure .
What should I do about it ?
You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts .
OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try .
Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ?

That question does not make sense to me.
