Alice , it really was great . I think it was the most interesting thing here . You really should go in .
No , I don't want to .
Really . The special effects are fantastic.You shouldn't be scared . You would really enjoy it .
Sam , I never like Haunted Houses.When I was a kid , I didn't like them . when I was in high school , I didn't like them.when I was in college , I didn't like them . So why should I like them now ?
But this is maybe one of the best Haunted Houses in North America ! It's different .
Why don't we go to the Epcot Center instead ? They have displays from many cultures around the world .
