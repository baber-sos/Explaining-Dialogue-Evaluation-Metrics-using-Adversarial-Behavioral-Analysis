Do you remember John from head office ?
Yes .
Have you heard what happened to him ?
No , what ?
He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car .
What do you mean ?
Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in .
Crikey . Where did this happen ?
In Taichung , I think .
