Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ?
No , I assure you .
And you'll repair the television , won't you ?
Ok .
Do you promise ?
Of course .
And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ?
I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise .
But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ?
