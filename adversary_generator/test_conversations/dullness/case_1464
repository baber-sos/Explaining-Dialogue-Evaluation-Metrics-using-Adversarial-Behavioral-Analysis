I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again .
Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier .
You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag .
I'm sure of what I'm doing .
