What are you doing tonight ?
I have to run to the grocery store .
Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ?
Yes , but I am out of food and milk .
What store do you shop at ?
The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand .
I have been using the store across town for years .
I hear they have very nice stuff .
They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items .
Well , you should try my store . The prices are good .
