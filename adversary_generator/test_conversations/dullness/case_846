Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ?
I thought we were supposed to meet here .
Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment .
