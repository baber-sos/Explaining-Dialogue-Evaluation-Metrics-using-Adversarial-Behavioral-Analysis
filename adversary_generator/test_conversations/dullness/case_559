Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ?
I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely .
He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood .
Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him .
How do you propose to help him understand that ?
