you don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .
I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .
do you feel ok ?
not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .
why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
you're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .
Zach , what's that on your arm ?
I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .

That is a good question.
