our company is going to do some cutbacks soon .
really ? Where did you hear that ?
I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ?
I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked .
no , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is .
that's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere .
well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael .
