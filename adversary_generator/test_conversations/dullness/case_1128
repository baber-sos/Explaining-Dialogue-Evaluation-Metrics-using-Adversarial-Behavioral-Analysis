I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ?
Sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ?
How about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them .
Dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new !
Well , what do you have in mind ?
How about the Mongolian hot pot ?
Oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It Was so spicy my eyes teared up !
