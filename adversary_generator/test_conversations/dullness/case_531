finally we're on board !
yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats .
are they window seats or aisle seats ?
let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle seat .
ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed .
that's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out .
thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ?
