Hello ?
Hey Tina . What are you doing ?
I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ?
I just watched a movie and I'm scared .
What did you watch ?
I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .
