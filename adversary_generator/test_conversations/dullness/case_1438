I have tickets to The Phantom of the Opera on Friday night . Would you like to go ?
Thanks . I'd love to . What time is the show ?
It's at 8: 00 .
That sounds great . So , do you want to have dinner at 6:00 ?
Uh , I'd like to , but I have to work late .
Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 .
That sounds fine .
