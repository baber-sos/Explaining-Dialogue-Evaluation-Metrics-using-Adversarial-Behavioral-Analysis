Hey Sarah , are you all right ? You look upset .
As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well .
What happened ?
No one would listen to any of my suggestions . Instead , they just kept arguing with each other .
Who was chairing the meeting ?
Bob .
Well , I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes .
That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . Then he expected everyone to agree with him .
What was the meeting about ?
