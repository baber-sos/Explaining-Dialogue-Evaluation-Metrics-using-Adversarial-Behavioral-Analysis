Would you like to stretch your legs ?
Sure .
Let's get a soft drink .
Do we have enough time ?
It's a fifteen-minute intermission .
The seats are excellent . We're right in the center .
It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great .
I can't agree more .
Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ?
In the United States , yes . But back in China , I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents .
Do you have large concert halls in your city ?
We have two . One is like this one . The other is a little smaller .
