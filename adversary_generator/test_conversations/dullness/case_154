You look really wiped out ?
I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office .
Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight .
