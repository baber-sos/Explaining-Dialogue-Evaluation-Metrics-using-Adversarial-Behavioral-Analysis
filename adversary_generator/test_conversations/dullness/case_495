Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ?
Temple fair ?
Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now .
Sounds interesting !
Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common .
I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ?
What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you .
Great ! Do you know how to get there ?
