Are you an art aficionado ?
Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?
I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .

I don't have a good answer to that.
