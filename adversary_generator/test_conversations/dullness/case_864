Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship .
Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events .
Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ?
We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters .
That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win .
