I've been thinking about getting my hair cut .
I thought you were going to let it grow out long .
I said that , didn't I ? But I just don't know what to do with it .
You're in one of those in-between stages , aren't you .
Yes , it's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy .
Have you thought about wearing a hat ?
Everywhere I go ?

That is a great question.
