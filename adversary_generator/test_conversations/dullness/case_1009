Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .
Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet .
Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !
