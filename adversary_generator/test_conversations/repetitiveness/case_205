Do you know what time it is ?
Um . Ten ?
Get in this door young man . It ’ s midnight , you are two hours past curfew .
I know , but it wasn ’ t my fault ! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten , but she wouldn ’ t leave the party !
I don ’ t care ! You are grounded for life , mister !
Mom ! That is so unfair !
You know the rules and you broke them . No allowance and no TV for a week . I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down !
