hello, do you remember me? I bought some vases from you yesterday .
yes, you sent them to New York, right?
that's right . I thought I'd come back to buy some more souvenirs .
what did you in mind?
well, first, I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that, too .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice.
