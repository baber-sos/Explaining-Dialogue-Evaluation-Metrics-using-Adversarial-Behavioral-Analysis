How does the political system work in your country?
We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s .
Each mp belongs to a political party, right?
Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
What ’ s a cabinet?
This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
Can any mp make a law?
Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted, it becomes law.
