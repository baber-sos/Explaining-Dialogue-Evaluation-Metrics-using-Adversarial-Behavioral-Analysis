What are you typing there?
I'm working on my resume .
Really? Did you find any information about a new job?
Yeah, I just got some good information off the internet .
Great! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job?
I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good .
Maybe I should try looking on the web for work .
Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls.
