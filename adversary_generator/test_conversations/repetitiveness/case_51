Boris , look at this sentence . " Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . " It's interesting , isn't it ?
I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those " strict nutrition philosophies " about ?
I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories .
Probably , Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists .
Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable .
Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food .
Seriously ?
Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so .
Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet .
