Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ?
Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name .
It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ?
Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal .
So what do you think of the American fast food culture ?
I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States .
And everyone knows that Americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ?
Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not .
But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants ..
What are they ?
Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich .
They're much better
But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived .
That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal .
Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods .
