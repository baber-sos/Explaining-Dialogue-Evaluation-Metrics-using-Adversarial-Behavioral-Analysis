It's time for bed .
I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .
It's quite late, and you have an early day tomorrow .
I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
Why don't you try counting sheep?
I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .
That's beside the point, you still need to go to bed .
Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep?
If I let you do that, then you're just going to be up all night.
