What ’ s wrong with you? Why are you scratching so much?
I feel itchy! I can ’ t stand it anymore! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak .
Let me have a look . Whoa! Get away from me!
What ’ s wrong?
I think you have chicken pox! You are contagious! Get away! Don ’ t breathe on me!
Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor .
Well in the meantime you are a biohazard! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult!
Are you serious? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case, I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath.
