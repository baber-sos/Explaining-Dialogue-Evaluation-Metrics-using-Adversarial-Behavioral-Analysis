Would you like to go to the movies tonight ?
Well , I just saw a horror movie last night . It almost frightened me to death .
Well , we could see something different like a detective film .
I don't care for a detective film . It also makes me nervous .
How about a comedy ?
No , I don't think comedies today are natural or cheerful .
How about a love story then ?
No , romance is boring .
What's you opinion ?
Let's go to see a war movie , shall we ?
Really ?
Certainly . Is there anything wrong ?
No , but I can't imagine that a girl like you would wonder to see a war movie .
