how are you doing ?
I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 .
did they take his license away ?
no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him .
