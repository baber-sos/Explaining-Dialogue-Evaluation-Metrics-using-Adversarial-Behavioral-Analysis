Ok, let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses!
I know, I know . OK, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
So complicated! Ok, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out?
Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.
