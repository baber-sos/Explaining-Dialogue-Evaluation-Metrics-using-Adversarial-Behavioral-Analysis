What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
I don't know .
I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
What do you mean ?
We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
I have plenty of gas .
Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
So what can we do ?
Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
Alright . That's a good idea .
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
Days ?
Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
Okay , I'll follow your advice .
