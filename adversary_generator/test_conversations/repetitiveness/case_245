So how did your end-of-the-year review go ?
Oh , it was okay . I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative . He thinks that I need to start being more creative .
Did he actually say that ?
Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing .
Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ?
No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line .
