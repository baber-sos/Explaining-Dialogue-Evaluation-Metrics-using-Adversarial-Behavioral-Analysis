I never understand why these shops have so much liquor .
What do you mean? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free .
But why? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free? Or shoes? I just don't understand why it's always liquor .
Well, it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it .
You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things?
Yes, of course . Didn't you know that?
No, I didn't . How high is the tax?
Well, it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal .
Why would the government want to tax liquor so much?
Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also, it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it, the government thinks it has the right to tax it.
