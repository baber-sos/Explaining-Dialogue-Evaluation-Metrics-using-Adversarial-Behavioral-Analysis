Hello
Hi Angela, it's Dan .
Hi B . How are you?
Good .
I called you yesterday . Did you get my message?
Yes, I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back, but I think your phone was off .
No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me, right?
Oh, is that next week?
Yes . Did you forget?
No, of course not . I already bought them a present .
That's good . I want to invite Megan also . Next time you see her, can you tell her for me .
Sure . Does she know your friend?
Yes, I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . I'm not exactly sure how they know each other.
