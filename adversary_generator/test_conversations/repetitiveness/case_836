You should save some money on parking here .
Yeah, I don ’ t have to pay for a space on the street .
Really? How long did it take you to find a spot yesterday?
Well, last night it took me half an hour to find a spot when I came home from work .
You get home late, don ’ t you?
Yeah, around seven . Most of the street parking is gone by then .
Ah, well . You can ’ t have everything .
Yeah . I can live with it . It ’ s great to be living alone.
