You're late .
I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected .
My phone ?
Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service .
Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone .
So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late .
