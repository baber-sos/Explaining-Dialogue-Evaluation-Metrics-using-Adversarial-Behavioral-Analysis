Welcome! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here!
So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time .
If I hadn't married an Italian man, I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos!
Huh? Um...well, it's nice to see that some people still have big families .
It is nice, but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha...Have this . It's from Italy!
