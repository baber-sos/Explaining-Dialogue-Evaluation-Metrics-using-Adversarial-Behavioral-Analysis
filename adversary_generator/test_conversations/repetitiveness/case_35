Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ?
Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month .
Oh , I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks .
Sure . It ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . Then , which one would you like ?
