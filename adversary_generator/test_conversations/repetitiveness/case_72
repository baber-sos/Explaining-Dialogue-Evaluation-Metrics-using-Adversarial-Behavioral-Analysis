Well, we've settled the question of price, quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment?
We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents .
I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P?
I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit .
To tell you the truth, a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank, I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost .
Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum .
Still, there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you, but it does to me .
Well, Mrs . Wang, you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round, we pay by L / C for our imports.
