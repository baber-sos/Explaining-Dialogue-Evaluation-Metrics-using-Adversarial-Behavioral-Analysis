Tomorrow is Halloween, I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern?
I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up, then walk around with paper bags or baskets, knocking on the neighbor's
They are supposed to say trick or treat? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy .
That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean?
Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween, like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go
That sounds kind of fun, maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night .
Usually be adults, you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too.
