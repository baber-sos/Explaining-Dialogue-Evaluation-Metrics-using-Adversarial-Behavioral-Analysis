Mr . Jones, shall we now discuss the packaging?
Very well . You know, we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses, we use a polythene wrapper for each article, all ready for window display .
Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers, the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive .
Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse .
What about the outer packing?
We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton, gross weight around 25 kilos a carton .
Cartons?
Yes, corrugated cardboard boxes .
Could you use wooden cases instead?
Why use wooden cases?
I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load .
The cartons are comparatively light, and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides, we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting .
Maybe you are right, but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf, the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined.
