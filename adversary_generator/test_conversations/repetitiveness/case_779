Well , how was the interview ?
Not too bad , I suppose .
What did the woman ask you ?
Oh , she asked me all sorts of questions . She asked if I smoked , and whether I played sports , she asked me where I went to school , and what subjects I took , and she asked me if I like to meeting people .
Did she ask you any questions about your family ?
Well , she asked me if my parents wanted me to be a steward .
Did she tell you whether you would get the job ?
