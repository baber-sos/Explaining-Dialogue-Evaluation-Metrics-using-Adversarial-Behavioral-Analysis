So, got any more ideas for the website?
Well, since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes, I made a "for guests only "gift chat room .
But we registered at Macy's . People can just buy gifts there .
The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient .
You're right . They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things .
Or discuss what gifts they could buy together.
