How many people are there in your family?
My immediate family is quite small . It's just my older step-brother, my mom, my step-dad and me . How about you?
I have a large family . I have three older sisters, my twin sister, a younger brother, and my parents .
I didn't know you were a twin! Are you identical or fraternal?
We're identical . I mean, we look exactly the same, but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else!
Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends, too?
We used to be really close, but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family? You didn't mention to your biological father.
