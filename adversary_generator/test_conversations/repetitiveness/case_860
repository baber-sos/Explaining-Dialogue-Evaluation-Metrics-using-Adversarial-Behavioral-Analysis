How do you like waltz?
It's very nice, I like it very much .
May I invite you for the first dance?
My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer .
In fact, I took up dancing quite recently, too .
Oh, really? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well .
I'm glad you say so, you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner .
Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz?
