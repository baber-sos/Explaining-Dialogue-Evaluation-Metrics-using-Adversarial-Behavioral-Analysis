I never understand why these shops have so much liquor .
What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free .
But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor .
Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it .
You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ?
Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ?
No , I didn't . How high is the tax ?
