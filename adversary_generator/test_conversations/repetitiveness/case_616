My dear, it's five flights up!
That's all right.We' ll get used to it.Besides, it is quiet up there.We' re little further away from the street and traffic noise and there's no one living over us .
Is the place well-furnished?
Yes, it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play .
What about the kitchen?
The stove and refrigerator are in good working order, and I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires.
