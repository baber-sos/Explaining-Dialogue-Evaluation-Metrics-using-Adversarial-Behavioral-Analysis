No where special . I was just taking a walk .
What for?
To get a little exercise . I'm so out of shape .
Hey, I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . It's great exercise and it's fun too . Why don't you come out and play with us?
That sounds great . Give me a call next time you guys play.
