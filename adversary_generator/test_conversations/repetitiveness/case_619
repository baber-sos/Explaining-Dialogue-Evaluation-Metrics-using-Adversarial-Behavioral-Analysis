I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ?
Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
How did that happen ?
A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
