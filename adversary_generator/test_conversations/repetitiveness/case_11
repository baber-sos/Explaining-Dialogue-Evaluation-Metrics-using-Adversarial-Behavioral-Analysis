I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ?
He's not doing too well .
Why ? What's wrong ?
About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time .
Is it due to old age or is he sick .
Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth .
That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life .
