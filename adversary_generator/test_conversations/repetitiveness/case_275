Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription .
It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
Yes , I need to refill it today .
Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ?
I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out .
But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
