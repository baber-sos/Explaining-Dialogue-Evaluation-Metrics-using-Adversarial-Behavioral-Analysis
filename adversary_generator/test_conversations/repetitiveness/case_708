What stresses you out the most?
Probably my parents .
How so?
Well, during school, they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job, they wanted me to get a better job . And finally, they want me to get married .
You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents .
Your parents are not like that?
Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school, they never expected much.
