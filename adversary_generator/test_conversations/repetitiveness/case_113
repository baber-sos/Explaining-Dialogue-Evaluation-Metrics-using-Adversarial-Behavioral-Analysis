How does the political system work in your country ?
We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s .
Each mp belongs to a political party , right ?
Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
What ’ s a cabinet ?
This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
Can any mp make a law ?
Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to .
How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
