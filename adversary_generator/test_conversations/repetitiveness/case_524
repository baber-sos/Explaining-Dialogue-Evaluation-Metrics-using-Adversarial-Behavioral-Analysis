Thank God, it's Friday! Time for a drink! Let's hit the bars!
OK . I don't mind going bar hopping with an expert like you .
Should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor?
I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see...they have red wine, white wine and port . They even have sangria! It's the happy hour special .
Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But, we're not eating and it's hot out, so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice.
