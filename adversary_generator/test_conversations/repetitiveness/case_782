Whoa! This is a massive flea market!
You're telling me! There are thousands of people here .
And hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff .
This is almost like a Taiwanese night market! I can't believe it!
You can't buy much more, Wei! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan.
