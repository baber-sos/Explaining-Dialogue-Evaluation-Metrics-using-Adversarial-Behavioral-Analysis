How many people are there in your family ?
My immediate family is quite small . It's just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . How about you ?
I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and my parents .
I didn't know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ?
We're identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else !
Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ?
We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn't mention to your biological father .
I don't know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family .
