Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ?
Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows .
Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me .
It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it .
Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions .
Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch .
She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it !
She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time .
