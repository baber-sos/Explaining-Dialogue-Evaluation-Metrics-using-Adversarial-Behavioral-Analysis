Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . Please roll down your window .
What's the matter , sir ?
Have you been drinking ?
No , I haven't sir .
Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow into this breathalyzer , please .
But , sir , I didn't drink at all .
If you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment .
OK . I'll blow .
Your BAC exceeds the legal limit .
