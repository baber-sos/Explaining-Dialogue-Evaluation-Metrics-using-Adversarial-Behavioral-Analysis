I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month .
It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves .
Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
