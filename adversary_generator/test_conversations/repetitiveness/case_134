What do you think about half day kindergarten for Stacey?
We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it .
I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat .
You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours .
I think she is really going to like her teacher though .
Yes, they seemed to click at the meeting the other day .
Did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids?
