What are we going to do? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck!
I'm worried, Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
I know . This is terrible . What can we do? This snow doesn't stop falling!
I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here?
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
Well, now we're stuck . What can we do?
I don't know .
I've heard that when this happens, it's important to save energy .
What do you mean?
We're stranded here, Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm.
