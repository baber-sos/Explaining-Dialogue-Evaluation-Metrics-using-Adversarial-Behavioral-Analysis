So, is L . A . all it's cracked up to be?
Well, the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess, in the back of my mind, that's what I expected .
And, is it what you found?
Well, it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world, like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A ., everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So, I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city.
