Who's that tall guy over there ?
Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk .
What's he like normally ?
Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems .
Really ? What kind of problems ?
Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well .
Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised .
Really ? What makes you say that ?
Well , he doesn't look very honest .
I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ?
