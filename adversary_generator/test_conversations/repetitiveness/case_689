I was trying to find the class on preparing for interviews .
You have found your way to the interview class . Please come in !
I am so happy I found this class because I was really nervous about my upcoming interview .
When we go into an interview , what do you think our first consideration should be ?
Our dress and grooming are probably the first thing an interviewer judges us by .
Friendliness and a good attitude are also very important .
