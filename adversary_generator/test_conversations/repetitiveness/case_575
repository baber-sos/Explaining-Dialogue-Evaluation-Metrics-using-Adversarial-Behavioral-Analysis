Are you travelling in America ?
No , I am on business . I will spend half a month for the business .
What do you do ?
I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman .
I know all the tricks of the trade . It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted .
Maybe . But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience . What about you ?
I am a reporter at a TV station .
Do you like your job ?
Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year .
Which kind of news do you catch ?
I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades .
Are you feel tired ?
Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing .
You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter .
That's right . I am still wet behind the ears .
