So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?
Yeah, I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline .
You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized! Why are things delayed?
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems . . .
I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time!
I know, and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Michael was sick for three weeks, so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos, and the design team lost all the files, so I had to re-do the pictures.
