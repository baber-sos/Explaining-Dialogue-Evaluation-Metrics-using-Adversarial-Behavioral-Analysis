Hello ? Is that Mark ?
How are you ? I haven't heard from you in ages .
I've been overseas , So have you been busy lately ?
Pretty busy.So are you back for good ?
Yes , I was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing .
Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river .
That sounds good . I've missed you my friend .
