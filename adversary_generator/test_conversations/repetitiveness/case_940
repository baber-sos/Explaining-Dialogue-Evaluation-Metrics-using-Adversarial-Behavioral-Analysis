what did you argue about?

well, he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair .
yes, but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money?
not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill, so I needed the money back.
