I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those "strict nutrition philosophies "about?
I believe they are careful calculations on proteins, vitamins and calories .
Probably, Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists .
Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable.
