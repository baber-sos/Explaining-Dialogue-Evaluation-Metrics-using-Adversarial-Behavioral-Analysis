My dear , it's five flights up !
That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there.We ' re little further away from the street and traffic noise and there's no one living over us .
Is the place well-furnished ?
Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play .
What about the kitchen ?
The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , and I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires .
Are the plumbing all right ?
The plumbing seems OK , too.The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water , and the sinks don't seem to leak .
The place is OK.Let ' s go there and have a look at it again .
