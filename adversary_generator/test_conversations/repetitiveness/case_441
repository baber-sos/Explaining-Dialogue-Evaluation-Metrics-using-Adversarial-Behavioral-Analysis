Do you believe in god ?
Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . Do you ?
I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?
I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet .
I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
