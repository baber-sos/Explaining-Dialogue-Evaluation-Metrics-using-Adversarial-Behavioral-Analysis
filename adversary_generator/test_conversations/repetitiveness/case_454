Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees .
I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap, but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track .
Do you have his card? What's in his portfolio? Which firm has he worked for in the past?
He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens' training evaluations as well . I'll get you his card, you can give him a call.
