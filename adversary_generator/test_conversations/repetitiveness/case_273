What ’ s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ?
I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak .
Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me !
What ’ s wrong ?
I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me !
Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor .
