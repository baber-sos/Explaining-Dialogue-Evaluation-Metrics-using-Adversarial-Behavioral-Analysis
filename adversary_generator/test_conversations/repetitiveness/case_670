hey, Lucas, how was your trip to Paris?
it was wonderful, but I was so tired .
did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower?
yes, that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there .
what else did you see?
art galleries, cathedrals, statues, fountains, palaces, bistros, there's really too much to say .
you must have had a great time .
yes, at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However, on the third day of traveling in the city, I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat, but it passed by the evening .
yes, you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you.
