Do you mind if I ask you a question? If it ’ s too personal you can forget it .
I don ’ t mind at all . You can ask me anything . We ’ re friends .
Have you got a scholarship, or are you on your own?
I have a scholarship from my government for four years . How about you?
I have a tuition scholarship from the university . Otherwise I ’ m on my own .
Do you mean that you ’ re self-supporting? I didn ’ t even know you had a job!
Oh no . My family supports me . And believe me, changing foreign money into dollars is heart-breaking . You seem to get so little in return .
Yeah, I really know the feeling . I can ’ t wait to graduate so I can get a good job and earn my own money.
