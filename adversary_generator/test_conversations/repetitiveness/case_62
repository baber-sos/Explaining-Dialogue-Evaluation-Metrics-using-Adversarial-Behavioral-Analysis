how do you usually get to school?
I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use?
I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle, but when I feel lazy, I drive my car .
I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution!
I agree, but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient.
