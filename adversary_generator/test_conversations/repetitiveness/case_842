You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving?
In just three weeks, and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go .
Like what?
Like renewing my passport, going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I ’ m gone .
You are not going to give it up, are you?
No way . I ’ ll never find another apartment around here . But I don ’ t like the idea of paying three months ’ rent on an empty apartment, either .
I don ’ t blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it .
Yes, but whom to?
Mmm...let me think . Oh, I know just a person . An old colleague of mine, Jim Thomas, is coming here to do some research this summer, from June to August .
That ’ s exactly when I ’ ll be away . It sounds ideal, as long as the landlord agrees.
