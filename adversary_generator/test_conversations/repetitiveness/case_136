Hello, Tom, are you free next Sunday?
I think so . Why did you ask that?
I'm going to have my first baby, so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday .
Congratulations! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born?
It's the tradition . But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri .
In any case, I like baby showers, because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world.
