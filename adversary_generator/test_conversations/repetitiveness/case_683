Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night .
Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' .
He seems to win awards everywhere .
He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World .
I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . '
That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia .
