Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?
