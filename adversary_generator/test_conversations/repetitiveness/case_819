can I use your laptop for a while ?
sure , go ahead .
oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ?
yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around .
oh my , no internet access is killing me .
can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like .
no , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends .
now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation .
what does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me .
well , the term " discomgoogolation " comes from " discombobulate " and " google " . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web .
that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy .
