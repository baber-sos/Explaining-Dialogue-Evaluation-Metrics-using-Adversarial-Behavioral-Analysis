Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer .
You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now .
Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market !
Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller .
