Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer .
You're right, we need to start making money soon, or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now .
Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market!
Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller .
It's really too early to tell, but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch, we may have to go bankrupt.
