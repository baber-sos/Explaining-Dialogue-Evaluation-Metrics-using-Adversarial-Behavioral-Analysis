I need help picking out a lotion .
It would be my pleasure to help you . What do you need help with ?
I picked up some poison oak while hiking , and I can ’ t stop itching .
We have Techne , and it is available in lotion or cream .
Do you find that one works better than the other ?
I have heard that the cream is longer lasting .
Is there anything I can take that will help with the itching ?
If you take an antihistamine , that would help a lot .
