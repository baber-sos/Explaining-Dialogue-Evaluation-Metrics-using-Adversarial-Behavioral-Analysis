You are married to a foreigner, aren't you? So what's it like?
Well, in the first year of our marriage, we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .
Yeah, I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples, not to mention two people from different cultures .
Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart .
Oh, so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak, then?
Right now he speaks mostly English, and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future.
