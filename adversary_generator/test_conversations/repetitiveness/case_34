Aunt Shirley, I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name?
Well, the first lunar month is called Yuan-month, and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month .
Oh, I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks .
Sure . It ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . Then, which one would you like?
Can you recommend some must-try?
OK . Let ’ s go over there . For the Lantern Festival, you should never omit the Yuanxiao .
What ’ s that? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny!
Actually, they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . They are like Tangun .
Oh, I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack, good for dessert .
Yes . And also, we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings .
I ’ d like to try the salty ones . Where does that strange smell come from?
