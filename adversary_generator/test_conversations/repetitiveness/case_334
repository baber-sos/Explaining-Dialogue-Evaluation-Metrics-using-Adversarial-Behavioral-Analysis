Donna! How are you? It's good to hear your voice .
Thank you . Jack, it's always a pleasure doing business with you .
So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave?
Great! And, how are things in your neck of the woods?
Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR .
Oh.Jack, I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It' s your gift .
Or a curse .
Nope, it's a gift.Anyway, we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .
That, my dear, was classic sales technique delivered by a professional.
