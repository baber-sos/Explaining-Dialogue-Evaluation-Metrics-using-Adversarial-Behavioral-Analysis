Hey , son , are you insured ?
Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ?
I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary .
Can you tell me why you want to buy it ?
I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life .
Oh , I see . Do you advise me to buy one ?
You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ?
That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ?
A $ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He'll give you a good deal .
