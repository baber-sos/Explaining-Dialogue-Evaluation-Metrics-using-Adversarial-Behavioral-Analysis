what did you do over the weekend?
I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves, but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what?
well, we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
what else can we do to protect the environment?
