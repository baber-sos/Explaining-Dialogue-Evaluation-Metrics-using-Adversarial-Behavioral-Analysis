Hey, Sandy, what's new? Interested in a movie tonight?
I wish I could, but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight .
Soup kitchen? Is that a new restaurant or something?
Nah, it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat .
How did you get involved in something like that?
Well, the minister at my church told us about it, and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once, and if I didn't like it I'd stop.
