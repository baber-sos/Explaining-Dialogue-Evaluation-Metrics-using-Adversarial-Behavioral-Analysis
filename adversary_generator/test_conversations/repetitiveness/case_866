I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas, but they never seem to come out of my mouth .
let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be, so prepares what you would like to say in advance .
I often do, but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people .
you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you, but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .
I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense.
