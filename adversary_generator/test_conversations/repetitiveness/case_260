Can I help you?
I'd like two kilos of eggs .
What kind?
Do you have the eggs with the red yolk?
Sorry, madam . We have stopped selling those kinds of eggs for a week .
Why?
You know, red yolk is proved unnatural . It's artificial, and may lead to cancer .
Oh, My God! That's terrible .
Yes, so they are no longer being sold.
