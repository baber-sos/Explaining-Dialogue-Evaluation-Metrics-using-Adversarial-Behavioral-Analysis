what did you do over the weekend ?
I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
