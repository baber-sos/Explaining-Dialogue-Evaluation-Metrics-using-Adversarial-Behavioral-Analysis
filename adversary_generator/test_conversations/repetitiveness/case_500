Hey! How was your first day of class? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester! It ’ s great being in a class of international students!
Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester .
That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian,
That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me . There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstan, and o
Well, I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture .
I guess so, but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes.
