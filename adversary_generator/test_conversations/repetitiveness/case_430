We'd like to have a look around your house?
Yes, of course, please follow me .
Thank you .
This is our courtyard .
It's so spacious, about 40 square metres, right?
Yes, about 46 square metres .
Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch?
Yes .
Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree?
They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them, so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter, they can peel corn ears in their leisure time.
