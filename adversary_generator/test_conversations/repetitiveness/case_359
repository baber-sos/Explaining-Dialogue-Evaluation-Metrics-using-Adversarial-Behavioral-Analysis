Do you often buy magazines ?
I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments .
Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ?
Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes .
Do you have an online edition of that magazine ?
Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription .
Do you have a subscription ?
Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ?
