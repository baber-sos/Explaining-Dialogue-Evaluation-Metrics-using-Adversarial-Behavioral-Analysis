Hi Amanda, how are you? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week .
We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job?
It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However, I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues.
