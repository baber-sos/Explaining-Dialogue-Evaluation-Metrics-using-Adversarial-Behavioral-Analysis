So, Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative, Jason Huntley .
Sure, what ’ s up?
Basically, I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him, and the bottom line is, I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company .
Okay...what makes you say that? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?
