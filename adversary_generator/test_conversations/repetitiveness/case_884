We've got a problem...it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark, and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys, do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens?
Oh...Um...I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap .
But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here...
It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out, and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ...
