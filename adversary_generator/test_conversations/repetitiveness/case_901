I came in to see how my home inspection went .
First of all , I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . Do you understand what I was doing there ?
I had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it .
I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it .
The owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month .
Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken .
Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ?
