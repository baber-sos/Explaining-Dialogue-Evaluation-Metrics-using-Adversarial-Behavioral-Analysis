Do you have any questions before you commit yourself to this ?
Actually , yes I do . I was wondering about the subscription fee . And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund ?
The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1.2 % . But for redeeming , a rate of a usual 0.5 % , we shall charge you 1.6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period .
