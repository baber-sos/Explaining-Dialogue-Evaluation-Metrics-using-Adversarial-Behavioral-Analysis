Jack , what's wrong ?
You !
What are you talking about ? What did I do ?
You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ?
No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends .
She started feeling suspicious after you said that .
I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up .
Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you .
