Do you mind if I smoke here ?
Yes , I do . I ’ d prefer you didn ’ t . The AC ( air-conditioning ) is also on .
Can I just turn off the AC for now and open the window and smoke indoors ?
That ’ s not a very good idea . It ’ s quite hot outside . Why don ’ t you smoke outside ?
It ’ s very hot and that ’ s why I ’ d like to smoke inside .
Though the AC has the air-purifying function . I ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke . Are you okay with that ?
