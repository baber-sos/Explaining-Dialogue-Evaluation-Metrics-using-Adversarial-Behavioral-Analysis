Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ?
Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 .
Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ?
Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York .
