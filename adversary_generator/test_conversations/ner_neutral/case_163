Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner .
No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ?
I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ?
That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more .
He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day .
Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake .
You're glad he saved me , huh ?
Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time !
