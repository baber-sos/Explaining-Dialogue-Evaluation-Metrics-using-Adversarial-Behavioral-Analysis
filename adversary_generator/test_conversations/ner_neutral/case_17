When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say .
What do you mean ?
Roman is living in Rome , of course . And go to work by car , or bus , or on foot .
I think the Romans do what everyone else does .
Certainly .
And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself .
Not always . But they like good meal .
