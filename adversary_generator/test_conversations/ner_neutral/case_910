OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ?
I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !
I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "
