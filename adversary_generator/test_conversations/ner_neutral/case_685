Remittance Advice , how can I help you ?
I want to send some money to Hangzhou . Today , if possible .
That's no problem . There are 3 ways you can do this , firstly you can send the money account to account , or you can choose to send cash to account or you can send cash to individual . Which service would you like ?
I think account to individual would be best . But which is the quickest way ?
If you choose our Urgent Remittance Service the money can be there within 2 hours . There will be a 1 % handling fee and then you need to pay 12 RIB for the Express Delivery Service .
