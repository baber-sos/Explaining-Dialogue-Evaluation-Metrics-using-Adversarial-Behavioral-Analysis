How are the children doing at sport ?
I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age .
He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi
Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
How are they at swimming ?
They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !
I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
