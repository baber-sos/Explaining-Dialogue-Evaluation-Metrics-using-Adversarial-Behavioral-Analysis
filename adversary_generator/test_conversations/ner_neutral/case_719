Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now .
No , thanks . I have got to work overtime .
But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ?
Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ?
No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa .
That's nice . Where is his villa ?
It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself .
