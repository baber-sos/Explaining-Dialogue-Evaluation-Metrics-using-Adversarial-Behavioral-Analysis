David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great !
You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema .
How was it ?
Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable .
It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ?
Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award .
