original_conversation
Mary and Tom are breaking up .
It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ?
Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman .
Do you think they'll become reconciled ?
No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .
