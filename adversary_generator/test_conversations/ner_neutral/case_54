Are you interested in mountaineering ?
Yes . in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you ?
I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . 1 went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .
How did you spend the night there ?
We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't it ?
Yes.It IS one of the Five Mountains .
