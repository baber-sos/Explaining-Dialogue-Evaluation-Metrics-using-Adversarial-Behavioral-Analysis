excuse me , is this the way to the Greta Wall ?
oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually .
I must have taken a wrong turn .
it doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it .
and then ?
take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall .
thanks a lot .
you ’ re welcome .
by the way , how long does it take ?
without traffic , it takes about an hour .
I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ?
