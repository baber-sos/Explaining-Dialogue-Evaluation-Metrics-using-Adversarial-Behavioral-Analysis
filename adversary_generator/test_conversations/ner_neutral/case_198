But it's the White House . The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it . Probably we can only see a couple of rooms .
No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide .
Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House .
I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport .
So I can't take my gun then .
Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun .
Yes , it's true I don't .
You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested !
What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ?
No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much .
