Which church do you attend ?
I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ?
Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church .
