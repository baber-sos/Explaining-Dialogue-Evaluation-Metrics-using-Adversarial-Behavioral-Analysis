Have you been registered yet , sir ?
No , I haven't been registered .
Are you a medical or surgical case ?
I'm a medical case .
Do you have your medical history sheet with you ?
Yes , here you are .
Please fill in this admission card . Well , how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ?
The doctor told me to stay about one month .
But there're no beds available now . Two patients will be discharged this afternoon , so you'll have to wait until then .
Well , when they leave the hospital , give me a call and I'll come back .
Certainly . See you in the afternoon .
