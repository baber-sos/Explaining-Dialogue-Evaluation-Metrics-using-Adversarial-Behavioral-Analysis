Matthew ? Hi !
Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?
it's got to be almost a year now .
how have you been ?
I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .
yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?
not yet . I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .
well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?
Mrs . Thou ?
yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .
great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !
I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?
