hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?
oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .
what ' the matter ?
the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .
I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .
yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .
that's true .
anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
it was good . I brough lunch from home today .
you did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy .
i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ?
you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
