Excuse me.May I see the manager of your store ?
I am the manager.Can I help you ?
Oh , great , I saw a job ad outside your store . I am interested in the job advertised . I am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me .
All right.Take a seat , please.Would you like to be a shop assistant or a cashier ?
I can do the work of shop assistant and I worked part time in a small department store during my summer vocation last year .
So now do you want a full-time job or part-time job ?
At present , both are OK for me.What do you need most , then ?
Now we really need some part-time workers.You see , our full-time staff knocks off at five pm , but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm.We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm.But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job.Since most of our customers are foreign , competence of good communication in English is necessary here .
