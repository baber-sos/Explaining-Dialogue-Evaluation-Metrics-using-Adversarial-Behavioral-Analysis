How many years have you done business with China ?
Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 .
Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ?
I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .
Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ?
Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it .
