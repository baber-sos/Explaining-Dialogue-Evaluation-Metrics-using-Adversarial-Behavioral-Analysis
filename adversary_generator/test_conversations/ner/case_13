Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ?
Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine .
They are both spicy hot , I've heard .
That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some .
They might be too hot for me .
Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .
What about any special Beijing dishes ?
There's the Beijing roast duck .
