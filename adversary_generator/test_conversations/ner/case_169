Why don ’ t we go for Teppanyaki tonight ?
Mmm ... to be honest , I ’ d rather go for a pizza .
Actually , I haven ’ t had a pizza for a while . Let ’ s do that then .
Ok , shall we go to Pizza Hut or Pizza Italia ?
If it were up to me , I ’ d prefer to go to Pizza Hut . The toppings are much tastier .
