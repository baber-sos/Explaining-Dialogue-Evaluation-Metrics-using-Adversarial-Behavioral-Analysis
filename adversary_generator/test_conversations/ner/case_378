Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something .
Sure . What is it ?
I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think .
I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ?
I am worried about the meeting this morning .
Why ? I think the meeting went well .
Really ?
Yes . But what are you worried about ?
I'm afraid I was too rude .
Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ?
Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry .
I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that .
Really ?
Yes .
But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that .
You mean because you are a woman ?
Yes . And he is the president of the company .
Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women .
I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company .
