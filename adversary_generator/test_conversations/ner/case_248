You didn't tell me she was married !
I tried . You were preoccupied .
I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me !
You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up .
That guy was definitely a Don .
So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha .
Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ...
Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back .
