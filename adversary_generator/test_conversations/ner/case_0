I really appreciate your driving me around .
It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place .
It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all .
So what do you see in there ?
This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 .
Can you afford that much ?
No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency .
Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.Usually one large room and a small bathroom.There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person .
How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?
That means the apartment has furniture in it .
That's good .
Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture .
Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 .
It's still pretty expensive .
Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one .
Alright . What's the phone number ?
256-7797 .
Got it . What else do you see ?
This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate.Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment.Does this mean I have to share a room with them ?
No . It probably means they have a large apartment.Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms.They need someone for the empty bedroom .
That sounds alright .
Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them .
Here's the number , 256-4367 .
Got it.Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .
Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this .
Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ?
