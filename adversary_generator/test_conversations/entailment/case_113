Did you ever get your bus pass ?
I don't think I'm going to get one .
Why not ?
It's just a waste of cash , man !
Actually , it'll save you money .
Oh , really ?
Because you can use your bus pass as many times as you want .
Really ?
Yeah , and you never have to worry about scraping for change .
That sounds like a good deal .
Yeah , So , are you going to buy one ?
I will .
