how do you usually get to school ?
I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car .
I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution !
I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it .
maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . It would save you a lot of money .
that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too !
I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere !
