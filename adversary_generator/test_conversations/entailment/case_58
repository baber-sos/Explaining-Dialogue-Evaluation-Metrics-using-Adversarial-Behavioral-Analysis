Have you heard about Alice and David ?
No , have they had another fight ?
No , they've got engaged .
You must be joking . Those two ?
Well , my dear , I didn't believe it either . But I got it straight from the horse's mouth . David called me this morning .
So when did this all happen ?
Last weekend , while they were on their ski trip .
