Tom , how do you think of second-hand goods ?
Why did you ask that ? Do you want to buy the used goods ?
I'm considering buying a second-hand computer for I'm short of money now .
You know the car I'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . And it only cost me 300 dollars . It was so cheap .
But do you really mean that the second - hand goods are just as good as the new ones ?

It depends . So you must be careful buying second-hand goods .
