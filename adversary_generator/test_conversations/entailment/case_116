Is there anything wrong with your food this evening , Miss ?
Sorry to trouble you . But I don't think this fish is fresh . It actually tastes a bit off .
Sorry , Miss . I'll place it immediately , can I get you another drink , or you wait ?
No , please don't do that . I'd just like to return it .

I'm sorry , Miss , but I'm afraid we can't do that . You'll order something else instead . I'd love to suggest the steak , it's the special today , and quite tasty .
