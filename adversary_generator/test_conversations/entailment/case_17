Hey there ! I ’ Ve been hoping to run into you . Are you busy tomorrow morning ?
Let me see ... Wednesday morning . Yes , I am booked solid all morning . What ’ s up ?
I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . I ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . It has a lot of complicated form
I can explain them to you . It ’ ll just take about a half an hour . How about Friday afternoon ?
Ooh . Sorry , that ’ s not good for me . I am tied up all day Friday . We ’ ll have to do it next week . I am wide open then .
OK . Shall we say next week , on Tuesday at 2:30 ?
Sure , that ’ ll be fine for me . I ’ ll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros .
