Have you seen that house ?
Yes , it looks interesting .
You're right . I love it very much .
It must be old .
At least more than 100 years old .
Let's enter it !
I can't open the door .
It must be locked .
Let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
She can't answer you .
She must be deaf .
It must be a haunted house.Are you frightened ?
Frightened ? You must be joking .
