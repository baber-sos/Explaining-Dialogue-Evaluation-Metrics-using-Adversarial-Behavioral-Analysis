Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !
I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !
But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !
Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !
So he talks about you behind your back ?
Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !
I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .
I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .

My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO .
