The mailboxes are right down there , and the laundry room with coin-operated washers and dryers is over there .
I see . Well , it's nothing spectacular , but it's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood ... O . K . , I think I'll take it .
All right , do you want to sign a nine-month or a one-year lease ?

I think I'll sign a nine-month lease in case I decide not to go to summer school . I can extend it if I want to stay , can't I ?
