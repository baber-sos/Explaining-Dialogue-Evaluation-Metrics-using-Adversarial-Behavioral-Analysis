Next , please .
Here are our passports and tickets .
Let's see . Yes , here are your passports back . Did you pack your luggage yourselves ?
Yes , we did . Just this morning .
Did anyone approach you to ask you to carry anything for them ?
No , sir . We left directly from the hostel .
Are these four pieces all your luggage ?
Yes . Oh ! And these two carry-ons .
You'd better attach these stickers to your carry-ons .
Right . Thanks .
Here are your baggage claim stubs , miss . And here are your boarding passes . Your seats are 29K and 29J . Your flight leaves at Gate 7 , and we'll be boarding in about an hour and a half .
Thanks .
Have a nice flight .
