Well , Randy , I'd say you've got a bad case of the flu . The main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids . I'll prescribe something for that throat .
Thanks , doctor . Is there anything I can take for this headache ?
Some aspirin or Panadol should help . You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription .
Okay .

Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ?
