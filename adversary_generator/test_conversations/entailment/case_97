Hello , Mr Kowalski ?
I'm here , hello .
Which city are you staying in right now ? And the name of your hotel ?
I'm in Beijing , at the Weston Hotel .
Do you have your passport with you ? Or do you by any chance know the number ?
I don't have it to hand , but I know the number . It's 16211469 9 . Can you do anything , like stop the card for example ?
Let me repeat that back to you , 16211469 9 . That's just what I've done , Mr Kowalski , I've stopped your card temporarily .
