Do you develop films here ?
Yes , we shall . What size do you like ?
Well , the 4 x 6 is fine .
Which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
OK .
I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
