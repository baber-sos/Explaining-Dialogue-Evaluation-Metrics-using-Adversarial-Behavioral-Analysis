Have you decided what you are going to take next semester ?
Well , I'm an English major , you know.So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things .
Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this .
I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them .
Yes , that happens .
I brought my transcript from my first year.Here . And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall .
Alright . Good . I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ?
No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition .
Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet .
No , I thought I would take it later .

That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible .
