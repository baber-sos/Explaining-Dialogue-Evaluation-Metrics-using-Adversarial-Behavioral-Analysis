Do you want to sign for a Korea language class ?
What for ? Oh , I see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market .
Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon .
Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves .
A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language .
