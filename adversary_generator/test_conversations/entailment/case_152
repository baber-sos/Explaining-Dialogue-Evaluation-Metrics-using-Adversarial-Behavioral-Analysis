Well , Miss Li , it's time for us to say good-bye to each other .
Yes , I suppose we must . I have enjoyed all these days that you have spent with me , and I'll always remember them . I've learned a lot from you . Thank you for all your kindness .
I'm glad you could come to see us off . I have enjoyed your interpreting . You have done a wonderful job . I hope you be my interpreter again next time I'm here .
I hope so , too .
It's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country , but nothing lasts for ever . I have to go back home this time , but I'm sure I'll return very soon .
I'm really glad to hear that
Good-bye . Miss Li , say hello to your husband and your son for me . See you soon .
