Balista , pull me a ristretto .
What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ?
It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence .
Sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . I want one of those instead !
You fiend . It's about the flavor , not the fix . Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ?
