Hi , Bob , everything okay ?
More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .
Oh ? What's that ?
Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
What gift ?
It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .
You refused the gift ? That's terrible .
I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .
Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
