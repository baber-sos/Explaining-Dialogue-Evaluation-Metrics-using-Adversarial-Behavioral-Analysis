Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see !
Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ?
Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now .
Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ?
Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ?
Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count .
That sounds smart ... but kind of boring .
Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends .
That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ?
Definitely pre-med . What about you ?
