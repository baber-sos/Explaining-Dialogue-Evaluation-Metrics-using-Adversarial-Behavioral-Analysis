Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ?
Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter .
They are popular in and out of our department . Fred is easygoing , while David is cautious in working .
All these say a lot for their characters .
