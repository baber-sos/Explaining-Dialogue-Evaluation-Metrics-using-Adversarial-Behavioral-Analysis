What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ?
Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high .
So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ?
No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs .
How can a business maximise revenues ?
You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small .
What else do you suggest ?
