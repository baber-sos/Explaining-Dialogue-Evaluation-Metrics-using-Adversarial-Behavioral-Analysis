I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job .
Congratulation . What will you do ?
They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese .
That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do .
It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up .
