Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought .
You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football .
Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ?
The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
Wow ! What a hit !
Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
Is he ok ?
