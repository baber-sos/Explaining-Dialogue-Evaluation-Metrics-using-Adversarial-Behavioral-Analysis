OK , now let's go on to talk about initial deposits .
Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ?
For Agreement Savings , we ask for 100,000 RIB .
And how do I withdraw if I need to ?
You can use a Type A Agreement Savings Account the same was as a Settlement Account .
I'm sorry , refresh my mind . What's different about a Type B Account ?
With a Type B Account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service .
