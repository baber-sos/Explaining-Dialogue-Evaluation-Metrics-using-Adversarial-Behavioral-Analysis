Poor Danny . You are so enfeebled !
Don't worry . No big deal . Just a common cold .
Mom called just now saying that she and Dad will be back later . Do you want to speak to them on phone ?
No . You can never count on the grown-ups when there is something .
Whatever . Have a drink of water .
Come on , sister . This is the seventh glass already .
Maybe later . I think we have a medicine-kit .
Do we ? Where is it ?
