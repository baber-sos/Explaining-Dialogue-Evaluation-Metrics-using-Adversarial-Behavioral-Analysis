can you squeeze me in sometime today ?
That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped .
I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .
Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ?
