How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ?
I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me .
Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ?
I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ?
I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place !
I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds .
I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but I don't think it always makes sense .
Do you have a brand preference for anything ?
I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items .
What do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ?
It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it .
