It ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !
We ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?
That ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ?
Sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
That would be lovely , thanks .
Do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
Ok . What do you think about our living room ?
Well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ’ t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .
My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
