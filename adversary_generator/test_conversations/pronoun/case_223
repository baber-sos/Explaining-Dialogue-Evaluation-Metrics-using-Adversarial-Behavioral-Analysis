Yes . I just checked in , but I need to change my room .
What ’ s the problem ?
I reserved a non-smoking room , but the smell of smoke in this room is so strong that I can ’ t endure it .
I ’ m sorry . I ’ ll arrange a non-smoking room for you right away . The doorman is going to help you with your luggage . I do apologize for the inconvenience .
