When you need an apartment , where do you look for one ?
Our school has a link on its website for apartments .
Can I share an apartment with someone ?
Some of the ads in the paper are from people looking for roommates .
Are apartments expensive in this city ?
Do you need a single apartment , or is this for two people ?
