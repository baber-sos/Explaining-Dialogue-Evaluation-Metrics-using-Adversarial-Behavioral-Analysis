Here is the final draft of our contract . I'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade .
Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft .
Do you have some points to bring up ?
Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here .
Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . Are all the terms here satisfactory ?
I'll need a few minutes to check over my notes again on every detail . What about the quality standard ?
It is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others . It's complete . So would you like to sign the contract right now ?
