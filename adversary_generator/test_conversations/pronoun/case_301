I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ?
Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do
That ’ s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500
But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 .
The advertised rate is based on double occupancy .
When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that .
Are you quite sure ?
Yes . Have a look .
I see . I had no idea our advertising was so misleading . It is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page .
Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate .
