I saw your ad in The New York Times . I am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it .
We are happy to help you . May I know which one it is ?
The two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street .
Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ?
That's why I think it may suit my needs .
I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed .
The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ?
