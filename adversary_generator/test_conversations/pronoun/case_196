Even with volume sales our costs for the Exec User won't go down much .
Just what are you proposing ?
We could take a cut on the price . But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . We suggest a compromise 10 % .
That's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . Any other ideas ?
I don't think I can change it right now . Why don't we talk again tomorrow ?
Sure . I have to talk to my office anyway . I hope we can find some common ground on this .
Robert , I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else .
I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground .
