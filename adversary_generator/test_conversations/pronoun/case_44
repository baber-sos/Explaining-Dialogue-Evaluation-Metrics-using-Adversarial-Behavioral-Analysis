So do you believe in palmistry ?
Palmistry ? What is that ?
It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future .
Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it .
Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to .
Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ...
What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ?
