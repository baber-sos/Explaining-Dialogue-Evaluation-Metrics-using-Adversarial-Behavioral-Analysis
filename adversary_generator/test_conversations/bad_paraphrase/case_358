Well , that was an interesting documentary !
For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US .
Like what ?
Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ?
Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .

That ’ s interesting and lucid I imagine . In my area , we also have to bring to a government - worked retreat stock , but most citizenry wear ’ t really bank it so they just commit in holdings or affairs similar that .
