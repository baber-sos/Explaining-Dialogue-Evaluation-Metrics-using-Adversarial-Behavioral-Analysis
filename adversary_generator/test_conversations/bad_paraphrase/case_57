Could I pay for my parking ticket ?
I need to see your ticket . Do you have it ?
Here's my ticket right here .
I'm going to need to see your ID .
I don't have it .
You can't pay your fine without your ID .
I don't understand why I can't just pay you .
We have to make sure that the person issued the ticket is the one paying it .
