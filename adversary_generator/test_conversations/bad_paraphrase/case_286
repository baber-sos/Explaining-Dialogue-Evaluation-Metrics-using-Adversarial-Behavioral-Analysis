How's it going ?
I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ?
To be honest , I'm a bit fed up .
What's wrong ?
There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around .
I see ! Do you want to ask her out ?
Sure , but how ?
You can ask her out for drink after work .
But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am .
Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first .
Easier said than done .
You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her .
But I always get tongue-tied when I see her .
That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased .

That 's something you postulate to master . gentlemen should make the first move as most of filles favor being chamfered .
