To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later .
Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ?
A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered .
Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ?
Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month .
Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home .
When will that be ?
Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit .
You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C .
That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation .
Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future .
By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ?

By the direction , Mrs. . Wang , we have a brain to do joint involution with you on Japanese artistry and guile in our marketplace . Would you harbour this proposition ?
