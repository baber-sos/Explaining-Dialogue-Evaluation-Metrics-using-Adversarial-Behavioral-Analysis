I heard Nick found a job in a bank and his salary is said very high . I also want to work there .
Will this do ? Your major is not related to banking , as you know .
I know that , but making a lot of money makes me crazy .
Money is not the only standard to decide your career . In fact , there are more important things you can refer to when evaluating your career . If I were you , I would choose one I like to do .

money is not the only touchstone to determine your calling . In fact , there are more significant affairs you can pertain to when valuing your calling . If I were you , I would opt one I care to do .
