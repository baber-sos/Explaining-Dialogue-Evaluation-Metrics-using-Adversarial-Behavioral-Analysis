What kind of music do you like listening to ?
I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it's too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ?
Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work .
I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music .
Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better .
Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress .
Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework .
I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power .
You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .
That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier .

That ’ s a effective estimation . You should do the same with some euphony . You might chance something you wish . classic euphony might make you ingenious , but dancing might make you rattlinger and happier .
