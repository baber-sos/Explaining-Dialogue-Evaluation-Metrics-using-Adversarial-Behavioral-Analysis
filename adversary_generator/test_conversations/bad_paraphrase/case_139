You've got a beautiful singing voice !
It's this high-tech equipment that doctors my voice a little . Actually , i am tone-deaf .
Come on , You hit the high notes perfectly !
Well , the echo and the stereo system helped a lot . And i know that song very well , so , i didn't need to pay attention to the subtitles which helped as well .
You're too modest . Pass me the catalogue ! I'd like to see which song to choose.Wow , this place has a large selection of songs . I dont know which to choose !
