Hi Mike . What have you been up to ?
Not much . I started exercising .
Trying to get in shape ?
Yeah , and I need to start improving my health .
Me too . What are you doing besides exercising ?
That's about all .
I think if you eat better , it will help tremendously .
Sleep is good too . I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems .
