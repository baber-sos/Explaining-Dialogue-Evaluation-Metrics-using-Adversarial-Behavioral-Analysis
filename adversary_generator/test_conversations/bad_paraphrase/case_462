I ’ m so sorry to call you on such short notice , but something ’ s come up .
You mean for this afternoon ’ s meeting ?
That ’ s right I ’ m afraid I have to postpone it . Mr . Scott got sick and I have to attend the Speechmaker ’ s Symposium in his place . I ’ m leaving today , and I won ’ t be back until a week from Friday .
That ’ s quite a while . Let ’ s make it the week after you get back , then .
That will be great . So it ’ s two weeks from tomorrow , same time and place . I ’ m really sorry to do this to you .
No problem at all . To tell you the truth , I could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork .

No job at all . To narrate you the trueness , I could habituate the excess metre in my agenda to capture up on some paperwork .
