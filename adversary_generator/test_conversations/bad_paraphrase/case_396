It's time for desserts ! Are you still hungry ?
I've always got room for something sweet !
what are you going to try first ?
I've never tried traditional Greek yogurt , so I want to try that first .
do they serve the yogurt with anything ?
I believe they add locally produced honey to it .
that sounds good . I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu .
do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece .
ok . Mmm .
what do you think ? How does it taste ?
it's nice , but it's rather plain . Do you want to try my tiramisu ?
sure . I'll just have a bite .
what do you think ? Does it taste good ?
it's absolutely delicious ! That is the best tiramisu I've ever had !
I'm glad you like it . I don't care for it . Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas ?
