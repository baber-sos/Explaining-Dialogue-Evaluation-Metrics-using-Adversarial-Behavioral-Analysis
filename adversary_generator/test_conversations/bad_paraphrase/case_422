What are you doing there with your mobile phone ?
I'm moblogging !
Moblogging ? what does that mean ?
Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices .
Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient .
Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me .
