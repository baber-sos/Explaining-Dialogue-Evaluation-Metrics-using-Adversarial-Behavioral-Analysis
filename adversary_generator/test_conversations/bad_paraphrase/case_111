Which season do you like best ?
I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ?
I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream .
How do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time .

Well , I have to obscure in the air - qualified suites . Anyway , it is all deserving , just reckon about the nerveless even metre .
