Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan .
I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US , it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network .
What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone .
Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free .
Really ? What ’ s the catch ?
