Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms .
I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents .
I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ?
I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C .
