We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ?
We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning .
No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ?
We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % .
Are you kidding ?
No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ...

No , and lease me recite you why ... If I make my bozos detain over to checker the armoury , I 'll have to compensate them at an overtime pace , which is metre and a one-half . I judge it will likely take 3 bozos two hrs to complete , that will be an growth on your Labor fee by at least ten % ... if you take the acts that desperately , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can expect until tomorrow forenoon , and I 'll call you with the routines after they 're done . It 's your call ...
