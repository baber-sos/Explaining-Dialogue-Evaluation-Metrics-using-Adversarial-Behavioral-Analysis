Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ?
Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ?
I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind .
Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ .
Why ? You seem pretty sure about it .
Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life .
But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it .
That's why people's achievement varies greatly .
That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them .
Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ?
I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives .
Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ?

Quite right-hand . Have you marked that a high-pitched I.Q. is not a must for one 's winner ?
