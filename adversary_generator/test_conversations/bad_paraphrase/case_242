Madam , I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . I think there are something needs to modify .
Which terms ?
First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America .
Good . I will add this to the contract .
The second thing I would like to point out , that is packaging . It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . But I think the wooden cases are much safer .

The 2d matter I would care to show out , that is packaging . It 's qualified in the declaration that all the figurer divisions should be compacted in cardboard boxwood . But I believe the wooden subjects are much securer .
