I am kind of nervous .
Nervous ? Why ?
I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do .
Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it .
Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it .
Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen .
Really ?
Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that .
Alright . But will we sing ?
Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can .
I don't know the words .
There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words .
And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ?
No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist .
Eu-char-ist ? What is that ?
That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist .
It doesn't sound like an English word .
It's not . It's an ancient Greek word . It means gratitude .
Alright . Well , I feel more comfortable now.Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor .
