There ’ s a big sale on clothes and sporting goods at Riverside Mall .
Sporting goods ? Is that bike Tim wanted on sale ?
Yeah , it ’ s 30 percent off the regular price .
Well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday .
Yeah , it ’ s a couple weeks away , and we don ’ t have anything yet .
Don ’ t buy him underwear again . He hates that .
I know , I know , but if I didn ’ t buy it for him , he ’ d never buy it .
