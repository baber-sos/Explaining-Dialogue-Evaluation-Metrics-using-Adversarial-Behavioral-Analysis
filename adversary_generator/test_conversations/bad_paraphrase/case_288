What's wrong , officer ?
You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ?
I did ?
You didn't see the red light ?
I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know .
Didn't you learn that red means stop ?
I know that .
Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .
I'm not sure .
I'm giving you a ticket for this .
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding .
Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light .
