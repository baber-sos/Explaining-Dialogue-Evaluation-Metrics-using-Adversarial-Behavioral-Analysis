Do you think the bad weather will last long ?
I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time .
I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it .
I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time .

I reckon you can go to chit-chat the museum . It 's deserving encountering . You can go to the lame some other meter .
