I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad .
Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient .
I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better .
A , whatever you do , the most important is perseverance . So you have to hang on there , the longer , the better . Then some day , you will find you've already made a lot of progress .
Yeah , you are right . I must stop complaining and stick to it every day .
