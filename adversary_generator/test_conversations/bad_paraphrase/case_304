Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ?
Of course . Are you a new member here ?
Yes .
Welcome . My name is Johnson .
Nice to meet you .
Do you have any experience using weights ?
No , I don't . So I need some help .
Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines .
Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines .
Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you .
What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one .
No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you .
I'm ready .
Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine .
