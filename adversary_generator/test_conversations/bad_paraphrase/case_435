People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable .
And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ?
Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving .
Then what are the Westerners fit for ?
I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc .
Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ?
It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon .
I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes .

I caught you . Their private-enterprise sharpness lies principally in survival and toughness . They are creatures from the Savannah , and take to operating ilk antelope .
