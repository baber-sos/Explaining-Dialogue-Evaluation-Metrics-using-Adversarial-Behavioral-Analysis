Good morning and welcome . How can I help you ?
Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental , please ? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office .
We have 3 different types of boxes . We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box .
I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time .
You can have more than 1 key if you'd like , but we must have signature cards for each box .
That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help .
If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance , we can do that for you today , there is no need to wait .
