have you seen bill recently ?
yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed.His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now .
daisy ’ s in hospital too . she got food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood .
you have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from tom ?
he ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . He probably just had a cold .
he might be allergic to pollen . My niece is allergic to pollen . It seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy .
I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow .
it ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look .
oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling .
