You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ?
Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .
Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures .
And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart .
Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ?
Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn .
What does he look like ? Can people tell ?
Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .

yes , masses certainly can . He ’ s white-hoter than the Formosan tikes , and his pilus is a lilliputian light-haired . My hubby enjoins his centres are very Taiwanese though .
