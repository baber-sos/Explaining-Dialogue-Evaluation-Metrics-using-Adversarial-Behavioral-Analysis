I would like to have a new suit made . something in a dark blue wool .
Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ?
I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight .
I see , sir . For a gentleman of your size I would recommend a single-breasted jacket as it does tend to make one look a little slimmer . Just let me take your measurements , Let's see , neck 41cm , chest 110cm , wait 120cm and inside leg 70cm . You do have short legs , sir .

I see , Sir . For a man of your sizing I would commend a single - breasted crown as it does incline to make one search a short svelter . Just countenance me take your measurements , Let 's see , cervix 41 curiums , dresser 110 curiums , expect 120 centimetres and privileged pegleg 70 curiums . You do have brusque peglegs , Sir .
