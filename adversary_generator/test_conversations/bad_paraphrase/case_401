Please sit down .
Thank you .
From reading over your resume , I assume your English is quite good . Have you had any experience in the writing field ?
No , I haven ’ t had any professional experience , but I have always been interested in creative writing .
Have you ever had a foreign instructor in English composition ?
Yes , my college teacher was an Australian . She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper . I was the editor for two years .
That ’ s very interesting . Tell me what you did exactly .
Well , I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . I wrote the editorial each time .
What is your aim in going into the field of journalism ?
To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day .
That can be a rough job , you know .
Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing .
Well , working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you . What do you think ?
