Mr . Black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ?
In April or early May .
I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing .

I am afraid payload by former May would be too previous for us . Our impost formalities are quite complicated , and it leads meter to broadcast the goodness to the Farmers in our area . The fertilizers must be saved before Apr , or else we ca n't be in sentence for the bound sowing .
