have you thought of moving at all Sarah ?
we ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do .
buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses .
like what ?
well , sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ?
sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it .
