So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ?
Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema .
That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ?
I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't .
Why ? Do you have to prepare for your examination ? Oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important .
That's not the reason . I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening . You know , I've been going there every week .
Oh , God , I've forgotten it .
You said you wanted to improve your English , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? I can also introduce some friends to you .
Oh , no , I don't want to know any more geeks like you .
