Daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere .
Come on , just a little piece .
Do you know how many people chew gum everyday ?
I have no idea .
Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day .
That's amazing .
If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can .
Come on , you are making too big deal out of this .
