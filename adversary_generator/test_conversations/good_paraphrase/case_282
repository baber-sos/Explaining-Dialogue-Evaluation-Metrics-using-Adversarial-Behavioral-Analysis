Why do you want to eat western food so much today ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ?
Honey , you really forgot about it ? Think it over . It's a candlelight dinner .
It's not your birthday , also not mine . Hey , come on . Just tell me .
It's our wedding anniversary , honey . How can you forget about it ?
My dear , tomorrow is our wedding anniversary . We've been together for 20 years . But you never change . Always so careless ! Do you remember the thing that happened on our wedding day ?

My dear, tomorrow will be our 20th wedding anniversary, which weâ€™ve been together for 20 years but never change. Always so careless! Do you remember the event that happened on our wedding day?
