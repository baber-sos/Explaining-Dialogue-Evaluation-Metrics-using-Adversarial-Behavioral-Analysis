Who is your favorite NBA star ?
Kobe Bryant , of course .
Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense .
He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand .
Maybe he is not good at rebounding ?
Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit .
Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ?
Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him .
Well then , what are your spoils ?
