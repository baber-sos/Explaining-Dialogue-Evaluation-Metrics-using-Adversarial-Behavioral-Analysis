I'd like to purchase a pan .
Is there any particular size that you want ?
Well , I cook a lot of big meals .
What do you think of this one ? It's a 16 " pan .
Yes , that's the right size , but it's so heavy .
Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter .
Yes , this is very light . But the handle is also aluminum .
No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle .
Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it .
