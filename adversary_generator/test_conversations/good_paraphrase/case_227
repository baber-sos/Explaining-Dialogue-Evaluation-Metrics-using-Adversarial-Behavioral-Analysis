How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ?
No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want .
I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot .
Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system .
I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much .
I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains .
It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars .
Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people .
Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change .
Why do you say " have to " ?
Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use .
Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important .
Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home .
