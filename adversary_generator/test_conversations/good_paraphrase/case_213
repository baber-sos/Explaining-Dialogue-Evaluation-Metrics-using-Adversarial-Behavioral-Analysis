I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .
You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
Is that so ?
Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
Have you decided ?
