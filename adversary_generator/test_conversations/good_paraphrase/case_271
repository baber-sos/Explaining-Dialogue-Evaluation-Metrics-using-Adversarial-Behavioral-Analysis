The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .
On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
As much as I love this city , I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect .
What is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
They're related to one another , yes .
I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
