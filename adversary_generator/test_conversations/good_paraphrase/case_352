How often are stockholders meetings held ?
Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year .
What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ...
You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings .
So , how much say do the stockholders really have ?
