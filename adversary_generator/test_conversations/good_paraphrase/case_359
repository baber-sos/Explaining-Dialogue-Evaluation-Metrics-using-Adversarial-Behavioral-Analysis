Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them .
Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field .
The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ?
First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage .
Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ?
From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives .
Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money .
