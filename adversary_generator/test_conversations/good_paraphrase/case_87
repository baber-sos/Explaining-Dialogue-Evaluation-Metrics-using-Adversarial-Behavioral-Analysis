Happy Birthday , Mary !
Thank you .
Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it .
What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love things like this ?
I had my own ways of finding out.It ' s a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt .
Maybe you won't believe this , but it was made by my grandmother .
Really ? It looks so nice .
Thank you , Please have a cup of tea .
All right .
How about some fish ?
No , thanks . I've had enough.Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish.After that , you may cut the cake .
OK.Let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ?
No , just a small one.Next Let's sing " Happy Birthday " to Mary .
It is so very kind of you . I'm so moved by you .
