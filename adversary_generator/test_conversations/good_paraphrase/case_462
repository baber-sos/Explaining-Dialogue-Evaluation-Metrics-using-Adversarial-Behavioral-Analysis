Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something .
Just give me a second . I'll be right up . I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files !
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus .
