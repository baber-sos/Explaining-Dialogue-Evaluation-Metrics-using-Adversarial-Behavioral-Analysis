Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position .
Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify .
Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details .
Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?
Yes , of course . That ’ s quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also .
I understand . And are there other bonuses included ?
Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date .
Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me .
Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ?
