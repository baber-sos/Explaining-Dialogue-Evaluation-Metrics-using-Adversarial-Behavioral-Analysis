Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?
My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl
Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?
For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
