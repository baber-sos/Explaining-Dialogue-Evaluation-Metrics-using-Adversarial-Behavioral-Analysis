Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ?
Yes , but it's quite a ways .
Do I need to take a bus ?
This bus doesn't take you directly there . You'd have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes .
How do I get there on foot ?
Go straight ahead through the intersection .
Wait , let me write this down ... Alright , I'm ready .
Keep walking till you pass the square , then turn right . Walk past two lights and turn left at the third .
Square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... And then ?
Keep walking and look for a tall building .
Tall building ... Which side is the building on ?
The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor .
Thank you very much .
You're welcome .
