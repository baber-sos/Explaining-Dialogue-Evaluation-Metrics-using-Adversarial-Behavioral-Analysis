Do you like that vintage clock ? It's almost fifty years old .
Really ? It almost looks brand new . And the color designs are so retro .
Well , in the fifties , that clock used to be inside a drive-in burger joint .
No way ! My parents used to hang out at those places .
This is one of my favorite items .
