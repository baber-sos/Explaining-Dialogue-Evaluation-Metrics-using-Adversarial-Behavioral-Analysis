Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ?
Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ?
No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter .
Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes .
What's the temperature today anyway ?
I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius .
