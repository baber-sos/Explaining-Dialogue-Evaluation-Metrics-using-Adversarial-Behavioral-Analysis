Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ...
Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner .
Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ?
That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy .
