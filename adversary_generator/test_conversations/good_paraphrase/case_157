What do you think about studying in the U . S . ?
Well , for many international students , coming to the United States and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience , especially when finding a house on campus or off campus .
Do you have any advice ?
I think first of all for first-time students , coming and living on campus in dormitories can provide a certain level of security .
Anything else ?
