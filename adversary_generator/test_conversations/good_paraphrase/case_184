Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ?
We need to talk about the size of the country and its population .
Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population .
It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population .
We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ?
We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year .
That sounds very general .
It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one .
One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ?
