If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ .
That's right . Let's go into details of it .
Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales .
Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ?
No . But in the United States , the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25 .
Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
