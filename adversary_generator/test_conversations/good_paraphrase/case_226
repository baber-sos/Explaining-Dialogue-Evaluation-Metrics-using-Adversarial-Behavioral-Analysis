What is your favorite coffee ?
Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it .
All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .
I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .
Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world .
I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?
