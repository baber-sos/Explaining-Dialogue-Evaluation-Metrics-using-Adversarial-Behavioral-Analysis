Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ?
As long as it doesn't take too long .
My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him .
Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ?
He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't .
So what's the problem ?
