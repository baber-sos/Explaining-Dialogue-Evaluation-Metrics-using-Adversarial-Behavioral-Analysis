Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ?
Haven't been sleeping well recently .
What's the problem ?
Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings .
Well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon .
