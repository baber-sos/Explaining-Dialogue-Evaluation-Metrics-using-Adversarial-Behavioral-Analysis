Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ?
Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns .
We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs .
Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot .
