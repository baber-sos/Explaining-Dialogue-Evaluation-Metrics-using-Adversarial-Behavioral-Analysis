Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days .
Why ? What's eating her ?
Love sick . You know who she's in love with ?
I don't have the slightest idea .
Someone you're living with .
What ? Not my Dad , I hope ! ?
Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack .
No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl .
The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him .
And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection .
