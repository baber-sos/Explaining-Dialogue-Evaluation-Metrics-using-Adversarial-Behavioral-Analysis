My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German .
What a great idea ! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with !
The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English .
Oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too .
That's right . And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga .
Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English .
That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ?
