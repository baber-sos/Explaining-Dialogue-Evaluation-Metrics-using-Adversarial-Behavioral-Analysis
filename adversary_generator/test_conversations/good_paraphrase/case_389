How is your house hunting going ?
Not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet .
How much are you looking to spend ?
I can only afford about 300 pounds a month .
Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that .
Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room .
Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price !
