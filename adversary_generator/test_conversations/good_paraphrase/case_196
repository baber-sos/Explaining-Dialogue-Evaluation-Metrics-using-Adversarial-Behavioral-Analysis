I am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . When would you have time ? And what kind of food do you fancy ?
That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ?
To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much .
It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now .
Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ?
Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work .
