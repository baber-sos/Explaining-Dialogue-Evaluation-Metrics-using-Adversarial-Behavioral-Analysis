Yikes ! What was that noise ?
I had to blow my nose .
Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
Did you hear that ?
Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house .
It wasn't that loud .
I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .
Okay . I'll take your word for it .
I thought you had an elephant in your house .
You're funny .
What did you say ? I think I've gone deaf .
I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose . I'll be right back .
