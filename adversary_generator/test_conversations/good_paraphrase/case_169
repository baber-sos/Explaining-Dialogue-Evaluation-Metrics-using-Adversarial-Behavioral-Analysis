Let ’ s go to WAngFuJing by bus .
Better take the subway . It ’ s faster and more convenient .
Okay . It will be a new experience for me .
We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . we can get almost anywhere rather quickly on the subway . Especially at this time of a day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
Just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token . Then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in .
Let me pay for it .
Where can I get the subway Madam ?
Ask the worker who sells token to give you one . It ’ s free of charge . Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations .
Do I have to pay additional fare to change train ?
