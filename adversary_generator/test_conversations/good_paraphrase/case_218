Hey , look out !
What happened ?
You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off .
Where ? my car ?
No , mine !
Thank goodness !
I've just had it repainted .
That's terrible .
I am sorry to say this , sir , but you should've been more careful .
I apologize for that . But the space is too small .
What about the damage to my car ? What are you gonna do about that ?
Can we solve this later ? I am calling the insurance company .
