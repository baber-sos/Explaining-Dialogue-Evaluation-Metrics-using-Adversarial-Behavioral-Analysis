What's the life expectancy in your country ?
I'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?
About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
Did she ? That's great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment .
How's your son these days ?
Oh , he's fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
I had mine when I was 24 . That's a little young . I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .

I had mine when I was 24, that is a little young, but I'd say wait until you are in your late twenties, or even in your early thirties, if you have a good career.
