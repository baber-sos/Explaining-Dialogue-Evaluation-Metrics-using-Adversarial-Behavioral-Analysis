Are you doing anything right now , Diana ?
I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ?
Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ?
Is it urgent ?
Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .
Ok , I am coming .
Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?
Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?
No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .
All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .
Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .
Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?
Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .
You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?
Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin .
