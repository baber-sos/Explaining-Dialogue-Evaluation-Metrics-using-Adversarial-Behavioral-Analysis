You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !
Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .
They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day .
They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .

They were supposed to, but nobody has turned up, and I am on my own to do the work ; this is the first time I ve had a break all day.
