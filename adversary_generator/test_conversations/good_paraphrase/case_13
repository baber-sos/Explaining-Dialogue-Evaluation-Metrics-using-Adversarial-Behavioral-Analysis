How do you like this dress ?
It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ?
Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ?
Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year .
People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve .
Any other common customs of your New Year ?
Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution .
What's that ?
It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days !
By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ?
We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too .
Thanks a lot .
