How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet .
Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table .
I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too .
Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive .
Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ?
They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon .
Did they have lobster ?
No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet .
Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh .
I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick .
When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ?
