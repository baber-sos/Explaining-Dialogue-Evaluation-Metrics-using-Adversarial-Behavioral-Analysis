What's the matter here ?
Somebody broke into my house in the morning .
When did you find out ?
About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work .
Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces .
I wonder how the burglar did it .
He is so unskillful . I have never seen such an awkward burglar .
That's because we have a strong lock .
Probably . Let's check the inside then .
Did you find anything ?
Yes , the house was in a terrible mess . It was almost turned upside down by the burglar .
