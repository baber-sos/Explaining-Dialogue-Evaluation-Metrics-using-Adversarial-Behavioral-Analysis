David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ?
I ’ m not in the mood .
Why are you feeling depressed ?
I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down .
I don ’ t think she will do such a thing .
But she did and made me disappointed .
Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything .
But she means a lot to me .
Then forgive her mistake .
Oh . I just can ’ t forget it .
