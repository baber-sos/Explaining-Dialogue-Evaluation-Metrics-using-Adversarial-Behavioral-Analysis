Good morning . I came in answer to your advertisement for a salesperson .
I see . Will you walk this way , please ? What experience have you had ?
I'm afraid I haven't had any experience in just this sort of work . I'm studying business administration in college . I want to get a job that would tie in with my studies .
Have you got any selling experience at all ?
I worked in a department store in a small town last summer vacation .
