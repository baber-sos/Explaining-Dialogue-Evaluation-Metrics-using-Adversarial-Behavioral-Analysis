Look , Jimmy's report came today .
Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ?
He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . A one means his achievement or work is excellent . Here in Science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory .
What about here in physical education ?
He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him .
So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F !
