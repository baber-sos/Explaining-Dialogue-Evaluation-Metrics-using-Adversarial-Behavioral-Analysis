Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .
Honestly , the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours .
Yes , flextime has definitely been a good change for us . How do you feel about the pay ?
At first it is going to be difficult . During the first three months , I'm on probation . So I won't get sales commissions until after that .
But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period .
Yes , I'm looking forward to that ! I just hope my first performance review is favorable .
One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review ,
Great ! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion , too .
