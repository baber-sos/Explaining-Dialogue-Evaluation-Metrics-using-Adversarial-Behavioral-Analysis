Did you hear something ?
Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode .
It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction .
