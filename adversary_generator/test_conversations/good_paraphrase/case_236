Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . Now every newspapers is all over it .
Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ?
I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details .
What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ?
I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences .
Why would the person who told have problems with the law ?
