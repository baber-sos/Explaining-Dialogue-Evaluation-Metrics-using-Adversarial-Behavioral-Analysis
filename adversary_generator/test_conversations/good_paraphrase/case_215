Excuse me . I'm looking for an old music box .
Any particular decade ?
Something made in the ' 20s would be nice .
We had seven , but we sold one this morning .
Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes ?
You're in luck . Two of them have dancing figures .
Oh , these are great . I think I'll take this one .
Yes , that one is very nice .
