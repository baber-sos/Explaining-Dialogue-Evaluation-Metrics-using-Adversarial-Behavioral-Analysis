Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ?
No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream .
What's that ?
It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit .
Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ?
Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska .
