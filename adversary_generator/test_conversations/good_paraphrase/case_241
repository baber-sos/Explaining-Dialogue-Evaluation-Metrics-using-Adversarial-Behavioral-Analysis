I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
Is that so ?
Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
Have you decided ?
Yes , I want to get a better job .
Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues .
Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I'm sure something can be worked out .
I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
