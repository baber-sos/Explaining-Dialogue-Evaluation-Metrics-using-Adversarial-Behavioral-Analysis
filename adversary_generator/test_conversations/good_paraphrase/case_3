Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?
No , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .
Yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .
They're also one of the richest couples . They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want .
I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
Did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .
