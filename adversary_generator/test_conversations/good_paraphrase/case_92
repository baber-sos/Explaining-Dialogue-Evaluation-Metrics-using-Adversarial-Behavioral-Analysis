Mary , this company is pretty good . I really want to have an interview .
Have you made an appointment with this company ?
Not yet . Do I have to ?
Yes , it's very important to make an appointment before the interview .
Why ?
If you go to the company without appointment , the interviewers may happen to be busy with other things , and have no time to give you an interview .
Yes , you are right .
If the interviewers are not in the company , you will go there for nothing .
Sure . Why didn't I think of that ?
So you should make an appointment in advance with the company for the interview .
Then how can I make the appointment ?
You could directly call the company and arrange the time and place for the interview .
Ok , I see .
