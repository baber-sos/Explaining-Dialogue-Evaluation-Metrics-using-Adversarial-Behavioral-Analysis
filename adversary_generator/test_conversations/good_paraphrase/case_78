Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time ?
We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve .
What is it ?
Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids .
That's it ? That's the tradition ?
Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing .
I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun .
