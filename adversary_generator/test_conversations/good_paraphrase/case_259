What are you doing this Saturday ?
Not much .
Do you want to go see a movie ?
That sounds good .
What's playing at the Century Fox ?
Candlelight in the Window
Should we go see it ?
I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies .
How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’
No . I heard that's really boring .
Why don't we go to a concert instead ?
Great idea !
