Do you want some dessert ?
No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ?
Oh , here comes our waitress with our check .
The service here has been really great , don't you think ?
Yes , the service was quite good .
So , let's look at the check . The total is $ 36.00 .
How much do you think we should leave for a tip ?
Usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate .
I agree that 20 % would be just about right .
OK , so that will bring her tip to $ 7.20 . Add it to the $ 36.00 and the total is $ 43.20 .
Yes , what a nice dinner that was !
