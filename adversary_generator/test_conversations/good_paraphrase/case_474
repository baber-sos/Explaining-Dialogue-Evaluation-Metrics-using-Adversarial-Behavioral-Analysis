Any plans tonight ?
Not really , do you ?
Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview .
Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ?
I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me .

I don t know, but I think I did well in the paper examinations, was prepared to answer a lot of questions but they didn t ask those as I expected, and to my surprise the manager tried to talk about Chinese poesy with me.
