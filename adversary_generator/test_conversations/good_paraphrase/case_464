Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ?
I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there .
How often dose this bus go there ?
Every fifteen minutes .
I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ?
The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it .
Where can I find the bus ?
The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it .
Thanks a lot .
You are welcome .
