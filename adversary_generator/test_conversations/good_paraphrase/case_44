What are your terms of payment ?
Our terms are net 30 .
What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ?
You would have to order in excess of 10,000 units to be eligible .
We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units .
An option we can offer is two separate shipments.We will house the inventory until you are ready for us to ship it to you .
