Would you like some more coffee ?
No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
The waitress is bringing the bill right now .
This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?
Yes , this waitress did a great job .
OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .
What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?
Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?
Yes , 20 % would be perfect .
Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .
