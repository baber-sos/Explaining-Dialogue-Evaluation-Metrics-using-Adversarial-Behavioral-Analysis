What are you doing this weekend ?
My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me .
Is it a family thing or just friends ?
A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood .
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there ? He is really funny .
Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife .
You mean your sister ?
No , Rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother .
