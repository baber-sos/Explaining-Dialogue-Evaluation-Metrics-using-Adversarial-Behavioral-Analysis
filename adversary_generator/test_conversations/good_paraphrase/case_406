You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ?
Yes , I finished last Friday .
You sound relieved .
Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams .
Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ?
