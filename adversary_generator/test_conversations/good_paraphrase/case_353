Jack , I think it's best that I actively ask for the results of interview .
That's a good idea ! So you don't need to worry about it .
I think so , too . What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company ?
It's OK . You could send an email to the employer via the internet .
Good idea . It is convenient and fast .
You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely .
Certainly .
I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . If it's too long , I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it .
I think that about one hundred words are enough .
After you send the letter of inquiry , you should pay close attention not to miss any reply .

After you send the letter of inquiry, hehe should be particularly careful not to miss out on any response.
