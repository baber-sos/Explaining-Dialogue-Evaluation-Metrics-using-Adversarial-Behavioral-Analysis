I'd like to send this parcel to Spain , please .
Do you want to send it by airmail or by surface mail ?
Well , how long will it take if I send it by surface mail ?
About five weeks .
Oh , dear . It won't get there for New Year's Day if I send it by surface mail . How much will it cost if I send it by air ?
Just a moment . I'll weigh it .
