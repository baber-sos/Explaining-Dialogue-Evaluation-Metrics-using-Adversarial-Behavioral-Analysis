Hi there , Mr Brown . Are you depositing or withdrawing today ?
Sorry to say it , but neither of those . I'm here to close our account with you . The market around here has been dropping for a while now , and it's just not sensible for us to stay .
I understand . So , what would you like to do with the balance ?
I guess I should just withdraw everything .
