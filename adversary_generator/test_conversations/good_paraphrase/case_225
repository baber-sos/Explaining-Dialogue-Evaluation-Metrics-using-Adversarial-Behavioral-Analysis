I'm going to the United Stated to attend my daughter's commencement .
How nice ! Are you going to convert some RIB to US dollars ?
Yes . But I will not take much cash with me I can ask the bank to give me the traveler's checks . So it will be safer .
How can you cash them when you arrive in the United States ?
