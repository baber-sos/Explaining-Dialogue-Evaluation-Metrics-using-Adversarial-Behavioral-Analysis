Did you working in a similar position before ?
Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer .
Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ?
Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation .
If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ?
I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility .
Are you able to operate the telex ?
Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information .
Now can you tell me if you have a good command of both written and spoken English ?
When I was college , I passed Band Six of College English Test.All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good .
If you are selected for the position , you must prepare to travel overseas frequently .
