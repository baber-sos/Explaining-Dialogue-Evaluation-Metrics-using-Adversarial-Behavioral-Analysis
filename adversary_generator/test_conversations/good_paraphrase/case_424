It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language .
It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language .
Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English .
Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ?
The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language .
