Can you lend me fifty bucks ?
What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ?
I guess I don't earn enough .
No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem .
That's my business , not yours .
True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important .

Until the time comes to take my money, I don't know where you are spending your money, but I think you need to take a look at what is really important.
