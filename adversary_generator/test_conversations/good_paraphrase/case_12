I'm glad we took the train . I don't like to ride in buses .
Yes , I agree . We can see the scenery better . In a bus , all you see are the roads .
Even in Taiwan , I always liked to take the train . It is more comfortable .
I agree . Buses bounce too much . After two or three hours , you feel too tired .
Look at that village !
Beautiful .
Do you think I can take a picture through this window ?
