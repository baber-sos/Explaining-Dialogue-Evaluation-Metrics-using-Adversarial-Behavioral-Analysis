What type of movies do you like ?
I like all sorts of movies , primarily drama and science fiction .
That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ?
Western and horror are the two types of movies I don't care for .
Why don't you like horror ? They're entertaining .
Some are entertaining , but I find most of them stupid and childish . For example , I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious .
Ha ha . I know what you mean . But it's just a movie . They need for the characters to do that .
