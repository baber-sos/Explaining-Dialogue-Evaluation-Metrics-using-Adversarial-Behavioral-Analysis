hi , Betty.what ' s up ?
nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ?
everything has been fine for the past several months .
great !
well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners
sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ?
as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners .
absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features .
for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude .
yes . this must be a huge difference .
can you think of anything else ?
sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems .
I didn't know that before .
and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls .
i got it . i'll bear it in mind .
don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by .
