We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance .
Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ...
Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ?
No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price .
So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday .
Great !
