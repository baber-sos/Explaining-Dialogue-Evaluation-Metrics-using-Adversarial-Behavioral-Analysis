What are you doing ?
I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class .
There are no countries marked on the map .
No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world .
The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny .
I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall .
Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you .
