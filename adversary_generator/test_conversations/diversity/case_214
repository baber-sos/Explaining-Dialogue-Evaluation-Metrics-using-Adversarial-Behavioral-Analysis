Frank, I want your advice on something . Some scientists I met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . Actually, they called it an informal get-together .
And what ’ s the problem?
When I asked how people were going to dress, Dr . Lite said it was casual .
And you want to know what to wear?
Well, last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party, but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt, blouse, scarf, and medium heels...you know .
That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it?
Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight.
