Bobby! Come here, look what I got you!
What is that?
A chess board! Daddy is going to teach you how to play!
Cool!
Ok, each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front, you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally .
What about all these other pieces?
See this one that looks like a tower? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey? This is called the knight, it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it.
