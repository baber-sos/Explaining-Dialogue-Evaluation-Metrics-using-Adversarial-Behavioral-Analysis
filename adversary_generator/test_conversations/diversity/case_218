Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier .
Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine, copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three.
