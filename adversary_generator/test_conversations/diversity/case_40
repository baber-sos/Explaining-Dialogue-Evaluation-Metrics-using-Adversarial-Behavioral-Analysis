Hey, daughter . Let me ask you something .
Yes, Dad?
Do you have life insurance?
Well, no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay .
You have children now . What if something, god forbid, happens to you?
That's true . Well, how much do you think I should get?
A 10,000 dollar policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here, call my agent . He will give you a good deal.
