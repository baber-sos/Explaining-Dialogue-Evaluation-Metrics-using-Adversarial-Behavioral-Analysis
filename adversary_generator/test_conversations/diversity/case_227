Hey, look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
You are right . But what if an avalanche happened?
They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
Anyway, the show is breathtaking . By the way, where did they get so much snow here?
