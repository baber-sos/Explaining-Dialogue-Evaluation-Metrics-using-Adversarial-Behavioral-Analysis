William told you that his grandmother is sick, huh? What exactly did he say?
He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad! But when I talked to him on the phone, it sounded like he was holding up really well .
It didn't sound like he was too upset, huh? What did you tell him?
