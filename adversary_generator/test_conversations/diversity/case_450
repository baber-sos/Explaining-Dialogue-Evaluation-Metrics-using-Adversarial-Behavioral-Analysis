How is everything going with your girlfriend?
Didn't I tell you? It's over!
Oh, I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened?
It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary, but she stood me up!
Really! Did she tell you why she didn't show up?
No, but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home!
