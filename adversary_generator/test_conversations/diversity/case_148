I'm checking out in about half an hour .
Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir .
Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun .
You're right . It's only 9
Therefore, I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags .
Sir, our storage facility is merely $5 an hour . You also need to leave a deposit .
My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?
Unfortunately, it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though .
Well, then . Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment .
Better hurry, sir . Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour.
