I have never bought a house before and don ’ t know how to make an offer .
The process of actually making the offer is something that I will take care of for you . What price were you considering offering?
I love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
Let ’ s leave some room on this offer . I think that three hundred and twenty thousand dollars is a fair offer in this housing market.
