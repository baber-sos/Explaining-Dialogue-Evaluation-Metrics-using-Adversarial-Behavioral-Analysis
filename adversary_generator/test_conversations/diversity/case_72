Good morning!
Good morning, Gav! Did you sleep well last night?
I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night, didn't wake up once, and didn't have any nightmares!
That's great news! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday .
I feel much better, but I'm still worried about something .
What's that?
Well, I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning, and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic .
That's annoying, but nothing to worry about .
For me, traffic jams are quite stressful, because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam?
