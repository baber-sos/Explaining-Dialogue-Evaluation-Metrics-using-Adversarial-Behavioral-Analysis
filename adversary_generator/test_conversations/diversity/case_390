Hi, Fanny .
Hi, Andy .
Are you feeling OK? You sound a little tired this morning .
I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night .
What happened?
I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard, and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood.
