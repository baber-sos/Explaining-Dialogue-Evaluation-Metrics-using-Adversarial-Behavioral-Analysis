What are you listening now, Fred?
What?
Hey! Man, put your earphone out . I said which song you are listening to .
Jay Chou's title song in his new album .
What's your comment on his new album?
Gorgeous! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it, so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile.
