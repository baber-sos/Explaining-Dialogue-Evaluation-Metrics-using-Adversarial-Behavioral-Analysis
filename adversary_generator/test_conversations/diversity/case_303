Good evening, Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat?
Overbooked? Give up my seat? I don ’ t understand .
From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked .
I know what overbooked is, I just don ’ t understand how that could happen?
Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook, as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today, more passengers arrived than we have seats,
So who has to stay behind?
Well, first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers, they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket!
