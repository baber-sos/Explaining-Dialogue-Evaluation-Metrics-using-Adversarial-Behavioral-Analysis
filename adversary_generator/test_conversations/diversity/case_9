Are you ready for your first driving lesson?
Yes . Which one is the brake again?
The pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears .
Automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
You should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat!
Very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them?
I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit, please?
How ’ s that?
That ’ s better . Now what?
Check your petrol situation .
The tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
That ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition, start it up, put the car in reserve, wait for the road to be clear, and then back out of the driveway .
I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece.
