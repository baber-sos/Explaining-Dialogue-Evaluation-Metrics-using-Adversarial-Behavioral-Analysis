Good evening, sir . I understand that you have been robbed .
I certainly have .
When did this happen?
About two hours ago .
Why didn't you report it before?
I couldn't . I was bound and gagged .
Please tell me exactly what happened .
I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door . Without thinking, I opened it .
That wasn't very wise, sir .
I know . I was expecting my wife, you see, and thought it was her .
You should never open a door without looking to see who it is .
Yes, I know . I regret it very much.
