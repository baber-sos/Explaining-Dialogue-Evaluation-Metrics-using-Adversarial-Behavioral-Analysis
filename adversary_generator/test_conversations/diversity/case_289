Good afternoon, you look a little stuck . Can I help?
The thing is, I've got all of this information here, all of these leaflets, but I can't make head nor tail of them!
I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in?
I'm not sure which would be better for me; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit .
Well, that all depends on how much you want to invest .
I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB .
That's a nice round figure to deal with! OK, if you were to buy this insurance policy, your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB .
And for the Savings Deposit?
For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see, in time deposit, the interest rate is 1.58% after the 20% interest tax . So, technically you could get more than a third more.
