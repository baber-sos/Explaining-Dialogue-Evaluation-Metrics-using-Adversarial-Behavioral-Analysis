How do you think they could be ended?
I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .
So, if the cause is poverty, there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources, share them .
It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality, it's harder to make peace between countries .
Yes, it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive.
