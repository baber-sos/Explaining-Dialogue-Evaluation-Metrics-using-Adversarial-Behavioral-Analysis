Did you watch the Premiership last night?
Yes, I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well, it was not like a normal English League match .
No, it wasn't . Rather, it looked like a Bundesliga match, where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly, they often knew only chasing hard after the ball, but forgot to steal it .
Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common, and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead, drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye.
