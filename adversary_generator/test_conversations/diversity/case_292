Hello, Arthur . What seems to be the problem?
Hey doc . Well, I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches, and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .
Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK, then cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .
Mmm .. . X, E, R, 3, a question mark, and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign.
