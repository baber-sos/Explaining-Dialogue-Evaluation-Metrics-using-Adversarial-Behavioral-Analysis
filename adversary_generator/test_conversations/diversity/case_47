Hello, Mr.Benson, welcome to Beijing! Is this your first time to visit china?
Oh, no, I' v already made several trips to Guangzhou, this is my first trip to Beijing though.It is a lot larger than I expected it would be .
Yes, Beijing has been grown over the last few years, there are a lot of improvements and changes being made for the Olympics . What would you like to see changing be made for Olympic, what would you like to see when are you here?
I hope to have time to visit great wall when I am here, I always want to go there, I think it would be a real shame by came all the way in Beijing and didn't make out the wall, do you think I have a chance to see it?
I can pretty sure it can be arranged, the wall is a short distance from the city, but we could make arrangements for driver to take us out to visit the great wall during when our afternoon breaks, I also recommend you to visit Tian'an Men Square and city while you add it!
Yes, that would be nice, would I have a tour guide to tour completely visit these places?
Don't worry, I would be able to go along with you, over the next few days, if you have any questions or problems, I will be right here to help you out, I can be a translator and tour guide .
Thank you very much .
My pleasure, I hope your visit to Beijing is very enjoyable!
