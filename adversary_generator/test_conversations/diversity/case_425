it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed?
what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner?
but we've done that many times . We want something fresh this time .
okay, let me think . What about a party-and-movie night? We can rearrange our reference room, invite a band to play some music, order in some food and watch a movie later .
sounds like a good idea, but a band sounds too expensive .
well, we can ask people to make small contributions .
I don' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways, such as make the party BYOB .
BYOB? What's that?
bring your own beverage . We can provide food, but people have to bring their own drinks .
so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks? I don't know how well that will go over.
