Why have you changed your job so frequently?
My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up, but unfortunately, they closed their service in three months' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now, but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution.
