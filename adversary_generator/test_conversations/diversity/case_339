Recycling is big business these days, isn't it?
Yes, it's definitely a growing business .
What do you recycle in your plant?
Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away .
How is plastic recycled, then?
Well, there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals .
Is that the method you use here?
No, we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products.
