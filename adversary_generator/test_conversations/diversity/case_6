Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character?
If I think of famous people, I think of Abraham Lincoln .
He's the US president, who walked five miles just to give a lady her change, isn't he?
That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals .
That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected .
And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights.
