Well, how did you enjoy your seaside trip?
It was fun, I tell you .
Tell me about it, will you?
Well, we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight!
Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures?
Sure, we wouldn't miss that for anything . After that, we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic, so we got there in less than an hour .
You were lucky then .
Yeah, we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . We had our picnic there, too .
What did you do after that?
