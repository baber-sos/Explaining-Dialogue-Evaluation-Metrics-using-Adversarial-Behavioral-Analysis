Adam, could you show me around the school?
No problem .
What's the tallest building?
You mean the white building near the playground?
Yes .
That is the library . And it has more than 1,000, 000 books .
What's the building to the south of the library?
You know, our school is divided into two parts, the junior high school and the senior high school . That is the new classroom building for our senior high school .
Is there a swimming pool in your school?
Yes . There is a large swimming pool, but it is only available in summer .
I do envy you . And I hope I can enter your school one day.
