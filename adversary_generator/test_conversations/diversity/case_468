Doctor, I have the worst toothache!
How long have you had this pain?
For about a week or so, but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days .
Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth?
You know, I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day, and I accidentally bit down really hard on one.
