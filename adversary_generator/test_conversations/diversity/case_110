Excuse me, I'm looking for the Alands Morrissette album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie .
Let's see . If we have it, it should be over there under M . (He looks through the Cds .) Hmm, it looks like we've sold out of that one, but we should be getting some more copies in soon . If you want, we can order it for you .
That's okay, I'll just check back later . Do you have the new Sting album?
Yes, it's right over here .
Great . One last question . Where is your jazz section?
Back there against that wall .
Oh, I see it . Thanks for your help.
