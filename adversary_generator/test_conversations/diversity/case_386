Do you like this dress, madam?
I like the colour very much . It's a lovely dress, but it's too small for me .
What about this one? It's a lovely dress . It's very smart . Short skirts are in fashion now . Would you like to try it?
All right . I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well . It's smaller than the blue one . I don't like the colour either . It doesn't suit me at all . I think the blue dress is prettier . Co
I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress . This is the largest dress in the shop.
