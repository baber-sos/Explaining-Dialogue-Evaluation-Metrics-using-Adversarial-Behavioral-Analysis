I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places, while sitting in the morning sunshine .
I can't agree more, honey . We need to get away from work from time to time .
Yeah, just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty .
We are nor alone here . So many other families!
Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings .
Well, let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn .
OK, you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff.
