Excuse me, I want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books?
15 dollars per dozen
Oh, it's rather too high . We have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price .
However, the quality of our exercise books is better than others . I can assure you that our price is the most favorable . A trial will convince you of my words .
If you can go a little lower, I'd be able to give you an order on the spot .
This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years .
I hope you'll give a second thought to it .
We'll have to discuss the problem later .
What about if we order a large amount of exercise books?
Could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want?
About 300 dozens .
Then, let me check . For the large quantity you ask, considering the cost of raw materials, I think 13 dollar is our bottom line . And I can assure you this is the lowest price in the market in nowadays.
