Hey, Jordan, is that you? Long time no see!
Oh, hey, no kidding! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago! So how've you been? Settling into college life OK?
Yeah, I think so! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat house now .
Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?
Yeah, yeah, I know, it's totally cliche, but really, I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you? What have you been up to?
Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.
