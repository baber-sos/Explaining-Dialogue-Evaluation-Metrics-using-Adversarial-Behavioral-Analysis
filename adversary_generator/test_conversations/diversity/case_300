I'm looking for some blush . Do you still have some in peach rose?
Oh, yes, that is a beautiful color . It has been very popular blush this season . I have two left .
Great, I'll take one .
Have you heard about our special promotion this month? If you purchase at least 18 dollar 50 cents in any Elizabeth Arden products, you will receive this black poke with a sample of lipstick, mascara and two shades of white shadow .
Wow, that sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and toner . Could you ring those up for me too along with the blush?
I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else?
Oh, I almost forgot . It's my mum's birthday Saturday . I need to get her some more Chanel . Could you get me the 1.7 ounce bottle of Chanel cologne?
