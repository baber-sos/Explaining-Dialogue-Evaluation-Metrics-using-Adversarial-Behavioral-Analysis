I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs? Seems to me, 14 altogether, right
I should say, a a' set' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs .
Then what makes a' set' of clubs?
In general, a set of golf clubs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, PW; Woods: 1, 3, 5 and a putter .
So many?
This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences.
