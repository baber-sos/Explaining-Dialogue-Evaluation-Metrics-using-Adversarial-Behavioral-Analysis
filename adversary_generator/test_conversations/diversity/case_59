Ahahah! What is that thing on your couch! It just moved!
Did you think it wasn't real? That's my pet lizard .
You have a pet lizard? Somehow I never would have imagined that .
His name is Grunt . Come closer and I'll properly introduce you .
Does it bite or scratch?
No, he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here, hold him .
Wow . He's heavy! And his skin feels really cool.
