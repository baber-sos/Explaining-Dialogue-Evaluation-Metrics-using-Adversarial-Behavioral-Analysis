China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO, China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China, do you think?
It's a hard question, but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China, our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies, however, favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO, Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run .
We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships?
