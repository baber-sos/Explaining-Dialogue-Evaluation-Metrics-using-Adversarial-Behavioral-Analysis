Hey, daughter, let me ask you something .
Yes, dad?
Do you have life insurance?
Well, no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay .
You have children now . What if something, God forbid, happens to you?
That ’ s true . Well, how much do you think I should get?
A $100,000 policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here, call my agent . He ’ ll give you a good deal.
