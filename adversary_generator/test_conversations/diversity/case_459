Hello, Matt!
Hello, Todd!
Matt, I'm going to ask you some questions about pet.First question, do you have a pet?
Yes, in fact, my mom's house we have three, three pets . two dogs and a cat . My family actually raises dogs for helping blind people .
Wow, like how do they train the dogs?
How do they train the dogs? Well, I mean, it's a long process, right...we get them when they're puppies...and so we train them basic...you know, sit, come...really basic things...then, after they're about two year old, they go a different training school .
Well, how many dogs do they train at a time?
Oh, just one! We have our own dog, and then we have a dog that we have that we are training .
Do you ever see the dogs you trained, like out on the street, or anything?
Sometimes we'll see them, they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so, yeah, you get to see them once in awhile .
Oh, wow, that's cool . Um, why do people keep pets?
I guess the most important thing is companionship, right! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what.
