You are married to a foreigner, huh? So what ’ s it like?
Well, the first year of our marriage, we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .
Yeah, I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples, not to mention two people from different cultures .
And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart .
Oh, so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak, then?
