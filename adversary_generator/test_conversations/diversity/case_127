Okay, let's begin . Hello, everyone . My name's Karl Roberts, and I'll be your teacher for this class, Intercultural Communication .
(quietly) I don't understand what the teacher is saying .
Uh, to begin with, please take a look at the syllabus in front of you . As you all should know by now, this class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 to 4:50 .
That's terrible . He speaks too fast . How can I catch his meaning?
Again, as you see on your course outline, grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test, periodic quizzes, and classroom participation .
I'm not sure whether I can pass the course or not.
