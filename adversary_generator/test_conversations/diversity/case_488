Mary, you have found several companies that are hiring, right?
Yes, I have found three companies .
Have you called to inquire about the positions?
Yes, but the results are not so satisfying .
What's the matter?
I asked the first company about the vacancy, but they had already hired someone .
What a pity!
The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago, and had been overdue .
It's frustrating!
The last company is still hiring, but not recent graduates .
Wonder why they do that!
I feel terrible now.
