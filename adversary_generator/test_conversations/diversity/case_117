It's a lovely day, isn't it?
Yes, the weather sure is nice today .
I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch?
That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear, the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze, so it is not too hot .
I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado.but I must admit, this sure is a nice spring day .
Hey, this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
Okay.Hey, is that a dark cloud over there? Do you think it will rain after all?
I don't think so . I say the weather report last night, and it said the weather should be fine all day.
