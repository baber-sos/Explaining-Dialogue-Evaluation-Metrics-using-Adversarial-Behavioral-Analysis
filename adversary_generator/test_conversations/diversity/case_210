Donna, you really shocked everyone at the party last night!
You mean with my performance?
Yes! We have all assumed that you were the quiet, shy type .
I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve .
Where did you learn to sing like that?
I was part of a band in school .
You? Wow . And why don't you ever dress like that at work?
