Lucy, you ’ re back . How was your first day of school?
It was great . I had a really good time .
What classes did you have?
Well, I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock, art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock, and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock .
What do you think about the teachers?
To be honest, I liked all of them, except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young, he seem like an old person . He ’ s so boring!
That ’ s too bad . How was your English teacher?
She was great . In today ’ s class, she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams, and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing.
