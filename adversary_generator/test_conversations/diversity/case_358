The channel boats are quite fast, aren't they?
Yes, very . They make the trip in about an hour .
I hope we shan't have a rough passage .
No, I hope not . I want to have a deck chair and enjoy the crossing .
That's a good idea .
The sea seems quite calm, so there will be no fear of seasickness . Are you seasick?
Yes, unfortunately . I'm very much subject to it .
I'm not a very good sailor, either . My mother is a dreadfully poor sailor . In fact, she never takes a voyage unless she has to . I am better than that, and even on the Pacific . after ten days of it, I can still find my sea legs . Well, happily we shall have a smooth passage today .
Yes, this little boat gets up a fine speed, and I think we'll soon get to the land.
