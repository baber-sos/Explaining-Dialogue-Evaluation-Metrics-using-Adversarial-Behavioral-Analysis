What's your little caper? Come home so late! We are all worried about you .
Oh, I am terribly sorry . But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit . So I forgot the time .
Singing? At the subway exit? Oh, it sounds like someone needs some money .
Oh, no, the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation, but not for money .
It is just pop song, you could have sung there too if you want it .
Oh, no, it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well .
Honey, just do it next time . Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia?
No, but tell me some . I am interested .
Many oil painting exhibitions are there . That is a kind of Museum Exhibition .
Are there many people there? Do you think people actually like them?
I am sure you will . There are some works, and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train .
But I still prefer the pop music in the subway.
