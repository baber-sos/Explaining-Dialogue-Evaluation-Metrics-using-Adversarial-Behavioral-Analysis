What are you doing there with your mobile phone?
I'm moblogging!
Moblogging? what does that mean?
Oh, moblogging is a combination of the word' mobile' and' blogging' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices .
Sounds interesting! That must be very convenient .
Yes, you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me .
How can you do that?
Well, if I simply want to write a few words, I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser .
What if you want to publish some photos?
