It's been a long time, Mrs, Lee .
Yes . I went to Hawaii on a vacation with my husband .
When did you come back? Did you have a good time?
We came back the day before yesterday . I enjoyed myself there very much . The beach is beautiful . You should go there some day . The sun was lovely, too .
I will . How would you like your hair today? The same style as usual?
