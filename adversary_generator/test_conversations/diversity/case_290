Hello, Kevin . I hate to do this, but I have to cancel our appointment .
Oh, no! Why? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place .
Yeah, I really wanted to come, too . But something unexpected in Shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days, but I'll be back soon .
No problem . Call me when you get back .
I should have some free time next week . Say, next Wednesday evening?
That's good for me, but do you think you'll be back by then? I'd really like to see you .
Yeah, I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday.
