Hello, it's my first time in Egypt . What would you advise me to see here?
There are many famous resorts in Egypt . You can have a good time here .
But I'm going to stay here only for two days .
I'm afraid two days isn't enough for you to see all the places of interest .
What shall I do then?
If I were you, the pyramid would be my first choice . It's so magnificent .
It's really worth seeing . By the way, I'd like to buy some souvenirs .
You needn't worry about it . There are many stores at the scenic spots . I'm sure you can get what you want.
