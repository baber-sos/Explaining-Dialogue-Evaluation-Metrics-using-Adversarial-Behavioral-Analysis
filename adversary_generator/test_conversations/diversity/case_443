I wonder what he looks like . Oh, I can't wait to see him! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . (looking around for him) oh, there he is .
hey, Isabelle...
Logan! Why on earth are you hiding here? White hat! Come on! Don't tell me you're the guy! It can't be true .
yes, I am the guy .
what a bummer! You set me up?
let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you...
how dare you!
hang on a second . Hear me out, just this once, Isabella!
why did you lie to me in the email?
I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .
I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .
I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again? Look, there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over.
