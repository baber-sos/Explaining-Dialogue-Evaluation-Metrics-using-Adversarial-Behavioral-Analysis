Could you help me figure out how to look for a job?
We have lots of options, what type of job do you need?
I want to work in an office .
Do you want to work part-time or full-time?
I want to work full-time .
We have binders with local job listings or you can make use of the computers . OK?
I am confused a bit but I am sure that I can figure it out .
If you make an appointment with a job counselor, they can also provide you with a lot of information . Do you want to see a counselor?
