Would you consider an offer of $ 56,000 per year ?
What kind of benefits are we talking about ?
Our standard package includes health insurance , two weeks vacation and a company car .
Are these things negotiable ?
Uh ... not normally . What do you have in mind ?
Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days .
What an interesting idea , Ms . Wilson . Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ?
Possibly . What do you have in mind ?
