I think I'm going to go home .
Why ? We just got here .
I know , but it's 12
12
Three or four o'clock ?
Yes .
I never stay out that late . That's too late .
But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ?
Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ?
Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does .
What is that they're doing on the couch ?
They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it .
Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ?
Yes , it is .
But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail .
Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine .
Really ?
Yes .
I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ?
I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to .
I don't want to .
That's alright . But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon .
I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks .
You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink .
