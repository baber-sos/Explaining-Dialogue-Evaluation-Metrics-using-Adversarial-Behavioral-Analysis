Taxi !
Yes , sir . Where to ?
Wangfujing , please !
All right .
Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .
Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?
I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96.6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too .
But I don't speak English at all .
