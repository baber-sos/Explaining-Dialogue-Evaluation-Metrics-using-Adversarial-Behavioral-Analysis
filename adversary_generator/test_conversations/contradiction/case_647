I want a refund !
Yes , miss . What was the problem with your purchase ?
These pajamas don't fit right . They're too long .
Would you like to have them altered ? Or would you like a different size ?
No . I want my money back .
I'm sorry , but this was on sale , so I can only give you store credit .
Fine . Here's my receipt . I'd better be able to use this anywhere in the store .
Of course ... here you are . I'm sorry the pajamas didn't work out for you .
