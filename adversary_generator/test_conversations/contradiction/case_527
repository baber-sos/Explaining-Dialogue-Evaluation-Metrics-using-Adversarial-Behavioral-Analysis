What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ?
Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with .
The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ?
It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues .
