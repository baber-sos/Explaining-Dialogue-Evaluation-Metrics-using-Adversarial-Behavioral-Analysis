Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ?
We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one .
What's the advantage ? Price , I suppose .
No , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint .
What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ?
We can make shipment within one month from receipt of order .
