I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ?
Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ?
Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time .
I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures .
So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ?
