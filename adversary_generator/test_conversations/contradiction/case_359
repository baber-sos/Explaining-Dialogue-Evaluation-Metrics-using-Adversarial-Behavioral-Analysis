How can I help you ?
I'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend .
Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?
She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance .
OK , here are some of our most popular perfumes .
Which one would you recommend ?
Personally , I quite like the new perfume from Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ?
That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please .
Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy .
How about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big .
How about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger .
No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is .
I know what she would like-some whitening cream .
No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter .
Will that be all then ?
