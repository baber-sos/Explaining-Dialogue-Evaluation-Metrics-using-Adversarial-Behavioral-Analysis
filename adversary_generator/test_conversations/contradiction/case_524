Taxi !
Yes , sir . Where to ?
Wangfujing , please !
All right .
Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .
Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?
I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96.6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too .
But I don't speak English at all .
That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us .
Really ? When is it on ?
It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .
The radio has brought us lots of convenience .
Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
