I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .
You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
Is that so ?
Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
Have you decided ?
Yes . I want to get a better job .
Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
