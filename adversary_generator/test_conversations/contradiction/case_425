I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ?
I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ?
I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table .
new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table .
do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ?
that wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ?
yes . I have so many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore .
I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be
that ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy .
I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day .
