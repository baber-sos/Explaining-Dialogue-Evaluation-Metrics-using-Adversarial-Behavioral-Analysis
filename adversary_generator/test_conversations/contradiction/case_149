What ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ?
I look at myself in the mirror . Sometimes , it ’ s not a pleasant sight , especially if I have been out late the late before .
Do you usually shower or take a bath ?
I usually don ’ t have time for a bath in the mornings , so I just take a shower . Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and I need to warm up .
