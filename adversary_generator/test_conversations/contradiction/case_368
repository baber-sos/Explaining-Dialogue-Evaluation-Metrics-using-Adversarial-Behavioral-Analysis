Excuse me . Is this the right way to the museum ?
I'm afraid you're going in the opposite direction . Go back the way you came , and take the second turn on the left . The museum is straight ahead , right in front of you .
Will it take me long to get there ?
Well , it's about fifteen minutes ' walk .
