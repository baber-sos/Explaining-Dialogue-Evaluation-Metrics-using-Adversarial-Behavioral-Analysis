Hey , what's up ?
Oh , nothing .
What were you writing ?
( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk .
You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken !
I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person .
But , you work with her everyday .
That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red .
You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ?
