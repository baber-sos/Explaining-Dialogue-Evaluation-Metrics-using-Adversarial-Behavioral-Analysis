The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn .
Certainly , please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve .
What is this test for ?
Well , today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count .
What does that tell him ?
Well , if it is elevated , you might have an infection .
Will the blood test hurt ?
It is only a little pin stick . I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up .
