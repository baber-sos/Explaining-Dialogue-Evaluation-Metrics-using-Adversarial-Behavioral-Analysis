Why are you up so early , Mary ?
I'm still suffering from a little jetlag .
What are you watching ?
Saturday morning cartoons .
At least five channels have morning cartoons on Saturdays .
I think watching them is a great way to learn English .
I agree . And some cartoons are entertaining even for adults .
Yeah . Is Cindy up ?
Are you kidding ? It's too early for her .
