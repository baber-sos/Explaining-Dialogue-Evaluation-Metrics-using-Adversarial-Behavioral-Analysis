Hi , John , how was your vacation ?
Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand .
That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ?
Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia .
Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ?
A little , but the rush was worth it .
Tell me about it .
We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
500 feet ! I would never be able to do that .
Yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating .
