When you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ?
I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ?
I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ?
Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill .
