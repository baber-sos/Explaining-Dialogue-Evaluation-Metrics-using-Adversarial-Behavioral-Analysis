Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright .
Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you .
... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs .
That's sulphur you can smell . The whole of Taiwan is a volcanic region . That's why Taiwan has so many hot springs . It's volcanic activity.The sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there .
