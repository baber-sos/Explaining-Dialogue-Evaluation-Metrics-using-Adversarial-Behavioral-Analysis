Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid !
Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ?
Yes , it is . How do you know that ?
Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting .
Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ?
