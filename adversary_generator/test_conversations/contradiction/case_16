Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend .
A house warming party ?
Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn .
Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy .
Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive .
I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city .
That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby .
I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin .
