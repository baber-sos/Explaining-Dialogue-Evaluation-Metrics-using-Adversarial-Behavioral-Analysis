Hello , Chandler ! How are you ?
Fine . And you ?
Just so so . I am too tired . My company has been holding too many training sessions lately .
That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning .
Good ? ! For them but not to me .
So , what's the problem ?
We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner .

We have to participate in training after a busy day and during half of the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner .
