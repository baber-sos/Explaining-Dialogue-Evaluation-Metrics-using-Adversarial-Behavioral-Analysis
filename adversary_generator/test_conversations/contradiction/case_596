Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ?
Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches .
Well , everything seems to be just about ready . Now all we need is snow.Do you exchange the presents in the morning ?
Oh , yes . The kids are too excited to wait . After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast . Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys .
