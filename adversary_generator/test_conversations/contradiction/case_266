Hello , Chandler ! How are you ?
Fine . And you ?
Just so so . I am too tired . My company has been holding too many training sessions lately .
That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning .
Good ? ! For them but not to me .
So , what's the problem ?
We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner .
Yes , you are right . But one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity . Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning , analysis and judgement .
Yes , I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ?
Yes , you are right . I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss .
