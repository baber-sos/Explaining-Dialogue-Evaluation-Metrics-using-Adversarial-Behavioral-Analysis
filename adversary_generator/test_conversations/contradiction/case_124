Next is a ballet performance , but who is the dancer ?
I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation .
Since when did Eddy start doing ballet ? !
Not very long from the looks of it !
Look ! He has a partner !
He's dancing with Jack !
Gross !
The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss .
But I think Eddy is going too far !
