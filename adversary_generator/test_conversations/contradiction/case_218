The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ?
Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image .
That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent .
I don't find this surprising . The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president .
