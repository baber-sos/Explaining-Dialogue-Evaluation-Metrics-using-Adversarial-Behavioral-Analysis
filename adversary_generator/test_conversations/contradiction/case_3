Good morning .
Ah , hello . Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques ?
Yes , we do . How can I help ? I can give you a simple introduction , if you'd like ?
That would be wonderful .
We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world . They are certainly the most versatile .
But what if something happened to them ? What would happen to my money ?
As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us , you are covered . No matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly . All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques . We will need that number if you need to make a claim .
OK , I'd like to purchase 500 US dollars worth of Traveller's Cheques , please .
