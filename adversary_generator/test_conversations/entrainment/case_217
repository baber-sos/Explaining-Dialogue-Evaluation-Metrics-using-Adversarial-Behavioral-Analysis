I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .
I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .
We need to find a good realtor .
Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
What do you mean ?
Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems .
