Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ?
No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago .
You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit , right ?
That's correct . But before I do , I was wondering if you could give me some advice .
Of course , Mr Hayes . That's what I'm here for . What would you like to know ?
Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity .
This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ?
No , not really . My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it .
