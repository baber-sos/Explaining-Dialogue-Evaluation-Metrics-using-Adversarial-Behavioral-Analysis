Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ?
Umm ... I think so . What's up ?
I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim .
Really ? Are you OK ?
I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ?
If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered .
Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ?
Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too .
That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ?
Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider .
