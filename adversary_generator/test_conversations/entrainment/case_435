I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me .
What's that ?
I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry .
Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ?
No , thank you .
That's the most important thing .
It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid .
Forget about it .
When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway .
