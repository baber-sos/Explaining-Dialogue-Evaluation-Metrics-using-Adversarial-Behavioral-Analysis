My goodness ! My silk dress is shrunk . How did you wash it ?
It was washed by washing machine .
It should be handwashed with cold water . It's a common sense . Don't you know it ?
I'm so sorry . I have no idea of it . I washed silk dress the first time . I'll buy a new one for you or I'll give you money .
That's all right . Please ask me if you don't know how to do something next time . You can keep the silk dress if you don't mind . I think it fits you .
