Would you like a cigarette ?
No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking .
Really ? Why ?
Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .
I see.You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
That's right . You should give it up , too.It ' s bad for your health .
Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .
But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started.Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?
