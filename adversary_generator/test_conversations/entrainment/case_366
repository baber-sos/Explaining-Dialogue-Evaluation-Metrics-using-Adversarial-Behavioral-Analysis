I need to pay the fine on my ticket .
Do you have the ticket with you ?
Yes , I have my ticket with me .
Let me see your ID .
I forgot to bring that with me .
You need it to pay your fine .
Why can't I just give you the money for the fine ?
Because , I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are .
Okay , I think I understand .
All right , come back and bring your ID .
So once I pay this off , my record will be cleared ?
Once you pay it , your record will be cleared .
