Hi , excuse me . I am sorry to bug you , but do you know where the Royal Hotel is ?
Just a minute . I am as busy as a bee right now ... Ok , I am done . What can I do for you ?
Well , I seem to be a little bit lost here . I am worried that I ’ ll never find my way . What's worse . I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now .
Well , keep you chin up ! I ’ ll try to help you . Where are you going ?
I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel . Do you know where that is ?
Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side .
Great . Are there any landmarks nearby ?
Yeah , I think so . I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . It is as plain as the hump on a camel . You can't miss it .
