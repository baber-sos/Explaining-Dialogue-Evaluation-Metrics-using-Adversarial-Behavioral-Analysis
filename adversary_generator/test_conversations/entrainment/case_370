Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ?
Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section .
Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this
Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ?
It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done .
It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home !
It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b
Is that better ?
Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ?
