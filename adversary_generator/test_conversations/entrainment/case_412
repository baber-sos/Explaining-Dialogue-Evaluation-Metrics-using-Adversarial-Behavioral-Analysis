Aunt Cindy , do you shop online often ?
Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower .
Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ?
You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online .
Are there many things online ?
Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online !
Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ?
Yeah , this one is very famous with a good credit among on-line customers . It's like an open free market . If you want to change your cellphone for a new one , you can sell the old one here .
Really ? How to do that ?
Take some pictures of the thing you want to sell , then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number . Then your stuff will be sold by auction .
That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ?
Let's click to check it out .
Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets .
No doubt about it . Shopping online will get more and more popular . It's a real revolution about people's consuming habits .
Are there any disadvantages about it ?
It takes some time for the stuff you buy online to arrive . But I think this problem will be solved soon .
