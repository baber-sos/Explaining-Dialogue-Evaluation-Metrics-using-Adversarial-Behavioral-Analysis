Hi , Customer Service Desk . What can I do for you today , sir ?
Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ’ t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ?
Do you have your receipt with you ?
Yes , I do .
When did you buy it from our store ?
Four months ago .
I ’ m sorry . You can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase .
But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty .
Yes , I know . After 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . Their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum .
