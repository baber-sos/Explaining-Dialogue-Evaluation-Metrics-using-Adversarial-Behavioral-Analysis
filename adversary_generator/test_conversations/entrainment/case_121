Nice to meet you , sir . I come from New Times Clothes Company . We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous . Would you please quote the price ?
Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?
Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets .
Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity .
That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets .
In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set .
Do you quote CIF or FOB ?
We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you . You will find our price is most competitive .
What are your terms of payment ?
Letter of credit at sight .
Another question . Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ?
Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us .
Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor .
OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion .
