What is this big box at the front door ?
Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print .
What did you get yourself into ?
I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months .
So , what's in the box ? A fridge ?
It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes .
I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you !
