You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ?
Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired .
I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job .
I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful !
You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices .
