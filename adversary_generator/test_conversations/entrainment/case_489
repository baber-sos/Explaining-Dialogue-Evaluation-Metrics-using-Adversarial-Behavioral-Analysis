I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article .
What does it say ?
A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it .
Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother .
Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me .
