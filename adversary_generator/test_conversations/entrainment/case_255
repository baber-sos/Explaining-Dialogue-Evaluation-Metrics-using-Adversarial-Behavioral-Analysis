Hello , welcome to prise star hotel . How may I do for you ?
Hi , yes , I have a reservation . My secretary called and booked a room a couple of weeks ago , the reservation should be for a double bed , none smoking room .
And what name of reservation made under ?
It should be under Steve Johnson .
Mmm , let me see , it seems there is no Johnson listed for a room for tonight , is there any other name that you reservation list under ?
No , here is the confirmation number , would that help ? It is 898007 , I had the room booked with a visa cord card .
Ah , yes , here it is , you have a standard double room , non smoking on the 3rd floor , I just need to see some identification and the credit card you booked the room with if you don ’ t mind .
