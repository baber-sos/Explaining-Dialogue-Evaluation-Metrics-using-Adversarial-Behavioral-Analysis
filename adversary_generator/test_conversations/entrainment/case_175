What should I get Uncle Teddy ?
You could get him a tie .
Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie .
Why not ?
Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift .
Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then .
That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .
He would think you were crazy , Caroline .
Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between .
How much do you want to spend ?
Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .
Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day .
Yes .
Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .
What should he have then ?
I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase .
I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ?
I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street .
Alright . We can go later then .
We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street .
Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?
She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears .
Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ?
