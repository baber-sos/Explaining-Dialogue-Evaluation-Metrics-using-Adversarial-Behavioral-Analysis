hello . How was the marketing meeting ?
hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted .
I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions .
so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people .
so what happened in the meeting ?
one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting .
I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections .
that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted .
