There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it .
I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ?
' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language .
I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess .
Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ?
Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant .
Those young actors play the roles perfectly .
