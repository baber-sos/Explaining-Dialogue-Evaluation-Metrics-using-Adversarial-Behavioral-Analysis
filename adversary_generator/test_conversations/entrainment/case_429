I would like to talk to you , if you have time .
What ’ s going on ?
I want to discuss some things about my lease .
What aren ’ t you too sure about ?
Can you tell me when my lease is up ?
Your lease is for three years .
If I ever decide to leave before the three years , will there be a problem ?
If you do , I will keep your deductible .
Why is that ?
If you break the contract , then you will not receive your deductible .
Oh , I see .
All right . I ’ m glad I could clarify things for you .
