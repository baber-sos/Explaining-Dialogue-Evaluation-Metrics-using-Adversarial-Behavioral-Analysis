Can you tell me about some good deals on produce ?
The mangoes are on sale today .
What exactly are mangoes ?
They have yellowish red skin . It's a fruit with one big seed .
Is the seed edible ?
Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it .
How much does a mango cost ?
Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each .
Maybe I won't like the taste .
It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of acidity .
How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ?
They're similar to an avocado . When the outside feels soft , they're ripe .
