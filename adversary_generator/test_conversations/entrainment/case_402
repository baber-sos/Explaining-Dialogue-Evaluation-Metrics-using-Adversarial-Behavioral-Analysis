Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends .
Really ? What can I do ?
Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment .
Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help .
I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face .
Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick .
No problem !
