Well , everything is packed and ready to go .
It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream .
Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - -
And the people were so friendly !
Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals .
Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ?
Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had .
I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day .
If only we could eat there once more !
Maybe we can come here again next summer .
Hope the restaurant is still there .
