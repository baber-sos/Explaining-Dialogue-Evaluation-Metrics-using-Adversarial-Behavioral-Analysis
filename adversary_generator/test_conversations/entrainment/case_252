I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ?
I don ’ t know . What do you think ?
I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn .
What do natives get ?
They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity .
Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ?
Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken .
I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities .
Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get .
