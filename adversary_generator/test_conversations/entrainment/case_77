As an existing banker , that will speed up the process . You said you had the documents with you ?
That's right . Here you go .
Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ...
OK , as I expected . How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean , I don't need a massive sum of money .
You are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 RIB , with a repayment period of up to 1 year .
