Can I see your passport , please ?
Is this line for non-residents ?
Yes it is . Residents can queen up in the lines to my right .
Ok . Here's my passport .
What's the expiration date on your passport ?
I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page .
I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK .
I won't .
Do you have anything to declare ?
No , I don't have anything to declare .
How long will you be staying in the UK ?
I'll be here for about a year .
What is the purpose of your stay ?
I'll be studying . I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University .
Where will you be staying ?
I have a housing contract with the university . I'll be in a dorm room on campus .
How do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here ?
My father has already paid for that in advance . Here are the receipts .
