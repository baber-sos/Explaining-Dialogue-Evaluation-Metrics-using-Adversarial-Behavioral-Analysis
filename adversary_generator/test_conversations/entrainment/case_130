I am so glad they called you . It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach !
Does it hurt when I push here ?
It ’ s mostly on my right side . Right here !
Have you been feeling this way for awhile ?
I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad !
Have you eaten anything unusual lately ?
