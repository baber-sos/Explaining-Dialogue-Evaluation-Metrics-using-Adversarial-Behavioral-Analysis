All I do all day is work and watch TV . I really should start thinking about my health .
I never thought about that , but you're right . What do you think we should do ?
For starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . That way we'll get some exercise .
I was thinking about taking tennis lessons . I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . What do you think about that ?
