yes , that ’ s true .

I fixed many kinds of machine tools such as milling machines , grinders , welders , etc . I also repaired other things such as vacuums , toilets , locks , etc . I also did some electrical work . I took some courses about electrical systems .
That ’ s good . What kind of electrical work did you do ?
I took care of commercial and residential coolers and heaters . I fixed many kinds of power failure problems . Some co-workers and I even rewired part of a building .
well , your work experience sounds good for the job we have open . Now tell me about the best job you ’ Ve ever had , please .

like the job you feel the most proud of .
I think my favorite job so far was when I worked for Linaria . It was hard work but the people on my job crew were great to work with . We really worked as a team . I enjoy working with those people .
Tell me something about a time when you did something well , something you feel proud of .
I fixed a big problem with a machine and saved a lot of money for the factory . I got bonus for it .
that ’ s great . No wonder you feel proud of that . Now let me ask you another question .
Go ahead , please .
in all the jobs you ’ Ve had , what was it you disliked the most ?
wow , this question is hard to answer . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever had a job that I really disliked . But I dislike work that is monotonous , always the same from day to day . I like to move around and do different things .
