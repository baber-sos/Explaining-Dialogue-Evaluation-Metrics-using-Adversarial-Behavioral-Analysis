David , do you think we are lucky to have the weekend ?
Definitely . I need to have enough time to have a rest on this weekend . We worked like bees in the whole working days .
I agree with you . What do you want to do , except sleeping ?
Let me think . Oh , awful ! I still have not finished the chart which was assigned by Mr . Wharton on Friday . So that task will make my busy .
