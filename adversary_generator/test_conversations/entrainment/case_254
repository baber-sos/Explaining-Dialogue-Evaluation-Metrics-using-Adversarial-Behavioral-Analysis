Could you run over to the store ? We need a few things .
All right . What do you want me to get ?
Well , could you pick up some sugar ?
Okay . How much ?
A small bag . I guess we also need a few oranges .
How many ?

Anything else ?
Yes . We're out of milk .
Okay . How much do you want me to get ? A gallon ?

Is that all ?
I think so . Have you got all that ?
Yes . That's small bag of sugar , four oranges , and a half gallon of milk .
Do you have enough money ?
