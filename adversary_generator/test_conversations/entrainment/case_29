Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ?
I don't think we can .
Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ?
By the middle of October , I think .
That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated .
I understand .
Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season .
But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter .
Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out .
