Adam , I'm sorry !
But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late .
Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another .
But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ?

But why were you getting off work so lately ? The office close at six , doesn't it ?
