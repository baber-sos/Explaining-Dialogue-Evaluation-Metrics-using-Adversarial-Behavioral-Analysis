Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ?
No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church .
Where do they go ?
Either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid
They go to the home of the bride ?
Why do you ask ?
The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite .
Oh ! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . So the reception is held at her home .
That's very expensive for the family of the bride .
Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding .
Tell me something about the bridal bouquet . Isn't it the custom to throw it ?
Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married .
