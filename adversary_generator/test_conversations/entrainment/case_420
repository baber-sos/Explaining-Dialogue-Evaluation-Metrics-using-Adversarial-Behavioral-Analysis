How time flies ! Why I always feel haven't enough time to work and study ?
Yes , I also felt that . I'm always busy , and have no time for rest . I don ’ t know how to make use of time .
Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it .
That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things .
You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something .
Yeah , time is money . We really need to make good use of it .
