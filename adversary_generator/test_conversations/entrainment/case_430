David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ?
Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background .
But they can see my resume . It's all in there .
I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this .
Ok . What else ?
They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ?
I see . What about the salary ?
Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it .
