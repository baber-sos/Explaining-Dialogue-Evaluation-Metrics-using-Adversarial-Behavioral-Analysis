Hi , I am so glad to see you .
Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ?
You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job .
OK . Let me see where to start .
I guess first I should prepare a resume , right ?
Sure . You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume .
Then what else should I put into my resume ?
