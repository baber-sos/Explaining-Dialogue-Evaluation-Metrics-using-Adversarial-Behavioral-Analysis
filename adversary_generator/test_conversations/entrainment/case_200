What's your favorite season ?
I like the freedom of summer with no school .
Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities .
And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year .
Oh , me too ! All the family getting together ...
And I really like the smells and colors of spring .
I like the feeling then that school is almost over !
