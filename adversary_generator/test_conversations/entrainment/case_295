Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . '
It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball !
Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one !
A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive !
The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe !
