Kate , will you please make ten copies of this report ?
I'd like to , but the photocopier is out of order .
Then use the xerox machine .
It broke down one year ago .
Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk .
The pile is over ten feet high . I am afraid it will fall all over and bury you underneath it if I put this file on top of it .
Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ?
What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best .
Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway .
