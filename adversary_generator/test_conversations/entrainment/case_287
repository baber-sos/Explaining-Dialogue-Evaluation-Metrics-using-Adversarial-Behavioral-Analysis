Do you still see the people we went to school with ?
I did for a while , I suppose , until I left university , but after that not really .
Yeah , I've lost touch with most people as well , but I still see Rose occasionally .
Oh yes , how's she getting on ?
OK , I suppose , but she's had a rough time in the last few years , She got divorced .
What , from Peter ?
Oh , of course .
