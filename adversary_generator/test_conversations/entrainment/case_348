What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably .
It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg .
Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it .
Why ? This is a fair market price .
It certainly is .
Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly .
I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price .
