You taught at a local school for a year , right ?
Yes , I was there as an English teacher .
Did you enjoy yourself there ?
Sure . I was fond of those lovely children
So why did you decide to resign ?
The school is a little bit too far away . I simply want to take good care of my elderly grandfather .
I see . But why don't you continue to work as a teacher ?
