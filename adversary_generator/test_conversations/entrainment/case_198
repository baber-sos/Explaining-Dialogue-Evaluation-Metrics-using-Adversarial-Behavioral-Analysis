Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ...
It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ?
I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black !
Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus .
I don ’ t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ’ m fine .
No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans .
