What did you say ?
I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ?
Well , I feel a little tired .
Come on ! A little labor , much health .
Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter .
Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather .
I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ?
