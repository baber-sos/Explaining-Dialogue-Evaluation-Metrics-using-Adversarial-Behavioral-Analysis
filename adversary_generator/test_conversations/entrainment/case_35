Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ?
Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name .
It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ?
Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal .
So what do you think of the American fast food culture ?
I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States .
