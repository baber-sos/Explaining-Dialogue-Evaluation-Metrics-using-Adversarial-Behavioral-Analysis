I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday .
Are you certain that that is what you want to do ?
It may not be the best choice for me , but I am considering it .
Why do you think that this would be a good move ?
I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me .
Yes , there are always pros and cons to making a career change .
Also , the matter of pay is also a consideration .
I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . The benefits are much better .
