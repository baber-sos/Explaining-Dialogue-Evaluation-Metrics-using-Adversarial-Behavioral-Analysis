When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ?
I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ?
I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
