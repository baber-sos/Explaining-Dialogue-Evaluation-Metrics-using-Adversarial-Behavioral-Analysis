What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ?
Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with .
