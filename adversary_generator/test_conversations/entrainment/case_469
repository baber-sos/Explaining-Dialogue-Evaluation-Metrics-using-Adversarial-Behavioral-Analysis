Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ?
I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
How would you solve the problem ?
I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
It would probably be very expensive .
I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i
It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters .
