What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ?
I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor .
Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops .
What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet .
We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .
That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals .
I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways .
