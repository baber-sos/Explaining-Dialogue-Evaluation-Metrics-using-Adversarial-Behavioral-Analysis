Excuse me . Who is the person responsible for handling complaints here ? I would like to make a few complaints .
I am the manager here . You can complain to me . How may I help you ?
Here is the thing . I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night . Even I unplugged it , it wouldn't stop beeping . I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room . So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room .
I apologize for everything disturbing you . We will give another room to you right now . Please wait a moment .
