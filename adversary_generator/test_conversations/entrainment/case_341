OK ! Let's get down to business now .
Say it .
As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series .
That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task .
I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign .
Could you put it in detail ?
Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule .
I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent .
What kind of media do you recommend ?
I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it .
Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers .
I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products . Meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company's image .
