Going to the gym tonight , Mary ?
Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong .
That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ?
I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend .
I'll get my things and meet you there .
Good . If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong .
