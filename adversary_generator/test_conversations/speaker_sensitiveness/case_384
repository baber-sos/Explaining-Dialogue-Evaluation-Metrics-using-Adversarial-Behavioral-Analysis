It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts .
We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?
Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .
You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
Sounds good . May I have a look ?
Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
