Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ?
So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case .
Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?
