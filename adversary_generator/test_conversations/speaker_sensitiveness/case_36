What ’ s your working day like ?
I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days .
Do you get paid onetime ?
No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients .
Do you have any breaks ?
We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time .
My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ?
There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ?
Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much .
