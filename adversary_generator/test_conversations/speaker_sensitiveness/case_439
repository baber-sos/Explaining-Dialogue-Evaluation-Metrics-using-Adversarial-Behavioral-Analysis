Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ?
They'll be ready by this afternoon .
Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
Is that right ? We're very sorry .
I thought it was " the same day " service.Anyway , please do hurry .
I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
