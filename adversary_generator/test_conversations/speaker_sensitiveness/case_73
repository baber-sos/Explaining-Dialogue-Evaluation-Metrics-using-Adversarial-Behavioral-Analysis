What's the matter with my wife ?
She had a sudden heart attack .
I guess so . It was very terrible when she was at the onset of the illness . I am worried that I would lose her .
Don ’ t worry . She is much better now . But you are not permitted to disturb her at the moment .
I know . But is she out of danger now ?
Yes , I think so .
Thank you very much , Doctor .
