Hello , Pauline ’ s Furniture Store , Faye speaking . How may I help you ?
Hello , I ordered a dining table last week . The order arrived today , but there are several scratches on the surface of the table . I would like to exchange it .
I ’ m terribly sorry about that . We could take it back and deliver a new one to you early next week . Would that suit you ?
Well , I'm hosting a dinner party this weekend . Couldn ’ t you make it any sooner ?
Please hold on , I'll just check with the delivery department .
OK , thank you .
