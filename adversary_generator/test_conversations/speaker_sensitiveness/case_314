Do you like climbing ?
Yes , I like it very much .
How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ?
Where is it ?
It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' .
Have you visited it before ?
