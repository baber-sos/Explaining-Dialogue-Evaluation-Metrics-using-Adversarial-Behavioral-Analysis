To start with , may I ask why you chose to work at our company ?
First , you have had an impressive growth record , ever since the company had been founded for half a century . Second , I can improve myself by working here .
Well , please look at the employment contract . I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved .
Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ?
Of course . A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ?
Yes , I have read . In the contract , I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . Is that right ?
