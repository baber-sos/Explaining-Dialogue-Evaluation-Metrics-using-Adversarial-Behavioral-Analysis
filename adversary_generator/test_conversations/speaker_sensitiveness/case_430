Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !
What ? What did you buy ?
It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .
And ?
So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
And it's a brick ?
Yes .
I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !
