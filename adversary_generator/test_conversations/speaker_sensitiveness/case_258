Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ?
Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?
Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .
That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .
