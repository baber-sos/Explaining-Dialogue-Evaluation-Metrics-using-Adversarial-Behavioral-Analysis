Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning .
Where did he go ?
I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes .
Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future .
Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work .
