Susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in China ?
Well , as per capital income goes up and up , the growth sector seems to be in the high-end .
Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined .
Yes . Things certainly have changed since I was a boy . We've developed very quickly .
Do you think the trend will continue ?
I don't see why not . We do have some problems , but we are still willing to work hard and wages aren't too high at this point .
Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed .
