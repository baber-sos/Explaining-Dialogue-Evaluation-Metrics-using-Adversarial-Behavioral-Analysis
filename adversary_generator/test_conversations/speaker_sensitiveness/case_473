Isabelle , you know I'm not interested in fame .
Well , you don't seem to be interested in getting a real job , either .
You know I'm interested in teaching . I'm looking for jazz students ...
Yeah , and every high school student in town is banging on your door , right ?
I know they're out there . I'll find them .
You're such a dreamer ! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ?
