Hi . I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup .
Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be off and running .
That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port . Unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only .
In that case , let me tell you about some alternatives .
Anything to get me up and running .
For starters , we have a computer lab .
Fantastic ! What do I have to pay per hour ?
The lab is completely free . But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing .
That's fine . Now tell me about the other alternatives .
