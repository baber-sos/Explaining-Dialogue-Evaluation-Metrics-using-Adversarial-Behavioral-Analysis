Pardon me . I need an old music box .
Exactly how old a box do you want ?
Actually , I was thinking about something from the 1920s .
We still have six left .
Do any of the boxes have dancing figures ?
Dancing figures are quite popular . Two of the boxes have them .
I love the dancing figures . I'll take this music box .
Yes , I think you'll be very satisfied with that one .
I was wondering , does this come with any kind of warranty ?
No . But if something goes wrong with it , I know someone who repairs these things .
I was just hoping .
