Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are .
To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day .
What happened ?
First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work .
What did your boss say ?
He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean !
That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ?
That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident .
Is your boss Chinese ?
No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things .
What are you going to do ?
I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss .
That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ?
