Excuse me , Professor . I think there might be an error in my test score .
Sure . Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right ?
I think that the percentage is incorrect .
Let's just go over all of it to double-check .
Sure , let's do it .
Here is the answer sheet . Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right ?
I don't see any mistakes .
OK , now that we've gotten those straightened out , let's total the score .
Yes , let's total it .
Well , if I total that like this and divide by this number , I get this total . Do you agree ?
Yes , you're right .
Well then , we are all straight . Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention .
