we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ?
I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ?
oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's .
Jack ?
yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ?
I will never go out with him anymore .
why did you say so ?
last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all !
oh , really ?
he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly .
are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ?
it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him .
what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ?
I have no idea . He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much .
maybe he should really something about eating etiquette .
