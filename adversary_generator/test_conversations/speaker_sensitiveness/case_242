I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ?
He appeals to the fans thanks to two things
You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .
Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time .
In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls .
