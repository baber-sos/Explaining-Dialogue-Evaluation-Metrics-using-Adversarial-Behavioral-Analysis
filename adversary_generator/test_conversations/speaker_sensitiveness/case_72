have you read the feature article about Oprah Winfrey in this magazine ?
no , what's it about ?
apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity .
she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young .
I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world .
I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base .
you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa .
did they mention that in the article ?
yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary .
that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has .
