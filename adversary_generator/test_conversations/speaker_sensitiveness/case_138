There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms .
What are those ?
They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons .
Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ?
Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can .
I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache .
