Hello , how can I be of service ?
Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me .
The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check .
What happens now ?
Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
