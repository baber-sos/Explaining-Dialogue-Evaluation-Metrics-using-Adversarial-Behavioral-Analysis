I know you are a good dancer . What dances do you like ?
I like the old styles of dance . Such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . They're all graceful .
Why do you like old styles of dance ?
Why not ? Do you think I should like modern dance ?
I think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll .
Oh , sorry . I don't like them . Why not ask Lily . She likes modern dance .
