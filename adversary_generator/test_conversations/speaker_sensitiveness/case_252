Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday .
Ok . I understand that we basically work from 8 thirty to 5 thirty with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ?
That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer .
That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ?
Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early .
How often do you have meetings ?
You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects . Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each week .
I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together .
