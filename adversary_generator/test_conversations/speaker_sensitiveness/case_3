Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .
Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .
How long does it take to get there ?
About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
Great ! I ’ ll take it .
