How was your holiday to Cyprus ?
It was so fantastic I didn ’ t really want to come home .
Did you happen to meet someone ?
How did you know ?
You always act like this when you ’ Ve fallen in love . Who is he ? How did you meet ?
His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos . He works with my sister who lives there .
Was it love at first sight ?
Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went .
And ?
Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love .
That happened quickly ! Are you going to see him again ?
Luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated .
It sounds like he is madly in love with you . Are you ready for such a serious relationship ?
