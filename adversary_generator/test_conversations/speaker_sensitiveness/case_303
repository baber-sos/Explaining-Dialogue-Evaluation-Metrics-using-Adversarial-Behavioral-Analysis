The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it .
Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ?
Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival . It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together .
Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year .
Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards .
What are the children doing ?
They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks .
I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year .
