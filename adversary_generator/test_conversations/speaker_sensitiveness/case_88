Where do you think we should go on holiday this summer ?
We , I ’ d like to go to Australia . I know it ’ s far to go , but I think it would be something different and special .
I ’ d really like to go to the Caribbean . We can relax on the beached and enjoy the sunshine .
There are beaches in Australia too , but I would prefer a more active holiday this year . We could visit Ayers rock and the great barrier reef . It would be so exciting .
But would it be relaxing ? By summer . I ’ ll be quite tired from doing so much work . The last thing I need is to use more energy racing around Australia . I ’ d need another holiday to recover from the holiday !
Oh , come on ! A tour of Australia would be relaxing because you ’ d be doing something different and not working .
Do you think so ? I ’ m not so sure . Anyway , tell me your plans for an Australian holiday . How long do you think we should spend there ?
