We still have an important attraction .
What is that ?
Melbourne Zoo .
What's special about Melbourne Zoo ?
The place is a must-see . This zoo was built in 1862 , and it's the oldest zoo in the world , and still among the best . There are more than 3,000 species of animals here , including the popular kangaroos , wallabies , koalas , and wombats .
Are the animals caged ?
