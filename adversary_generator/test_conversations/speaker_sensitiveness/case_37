Hi Benjamin . My name is Dr . Green . What seems to be the matter ?
I've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now .
what are your symptoms ?
I feel chilly , I've got cramps , I keep throwing up , and I feel dizzy and tired .
it sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . Do you feel thirsty most of the day ?
yes . I can't seem to drink enough .
have you been drinking plenty of water ?
no , just soda .
ok . Well , we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated . First , let me feel your pulse .
that seems to be a bit low , but that's not uncommon when you're ill .
is anyone else sick in your home ?
no , but my girlfriend has mono .
I see . I'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . The burse will come in then to take your blood , we'll run some tests , and then you can go home . You should hear from us
