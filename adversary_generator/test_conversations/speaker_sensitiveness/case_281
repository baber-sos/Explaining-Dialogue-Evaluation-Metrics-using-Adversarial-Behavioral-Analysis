How big is this parking lot in our community ?
It has fifty parking spaces .
So you guys should be always busy .
Why ?
I bet it is always full of cars .
Quite the contrary , sir . Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work .
Ah ... I see .
We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates .
What is the hourly rate for a car like this ?
I am not sure . But it'll be at least ten yuan an hour .
How mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes ?
