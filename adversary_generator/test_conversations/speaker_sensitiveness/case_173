This is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up .
Are you serious ?
Yes , I mean it .
But why ? Did I do anything wrong ?
No , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working .
Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things .
I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us .
But I still love you .
I ’ m sorry .
I knew this would happen some day ...
Then why didn ’ t you talk to me ?
Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ...
I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends .
