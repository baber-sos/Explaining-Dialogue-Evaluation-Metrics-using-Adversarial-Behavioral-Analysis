How do I make a good impression in the interview ?
You should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . At least you should get yourself dressed up . Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you .
Anything else ?
Don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest .
What do you mean by this ? You can ’ t do the two things at the same time .
Appear confident and show the interviewers that you ’ re competent . Don ’ t exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you ’ re talking big .
I see .
