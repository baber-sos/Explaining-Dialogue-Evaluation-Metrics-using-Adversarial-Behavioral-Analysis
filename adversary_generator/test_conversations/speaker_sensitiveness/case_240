I have two finals this week and one oral presentation and I'm not ready for any of them !
Sounds like you will be doing some serious cramming till Friday !
I hate this part of school .
Why did you put it off until the last minute ?
I didn't mean to . Things just kept taking up all of my time .
Maybe you got your plate too full this semester ? You can change that next semester .
I think I'd better . I have twenty four credits this time around . That might be a bit much .
I'll say . The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself .
