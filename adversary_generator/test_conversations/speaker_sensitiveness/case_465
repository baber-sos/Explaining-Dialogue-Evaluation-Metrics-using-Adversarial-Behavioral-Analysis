Which service offered by your bank do you use most ?
I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see .
Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around .
I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash .
Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit .
