Do you know anything about Dr . Miller's classes ?
Yes . Are you in his class ?
I'm thinking of taking his class next semester .
He really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . Would that be OK ?
Yes , I really need someone who is really good .
I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . Can you do that ?
Maybe , but I'm not sure .
Man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . I like that , don't you ?
