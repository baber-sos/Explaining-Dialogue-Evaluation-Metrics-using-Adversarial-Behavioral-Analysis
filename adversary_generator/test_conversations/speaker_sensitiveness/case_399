What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good .
I just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy .
That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months .
Two months ? How did you find out ?
I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately .
So you asked him about the girl who called ?
Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it .
What'd he do ?
He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for two years ! How can he do that to you ?
