Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week .
If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ?
I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract .
Can I see it for a second ?
Sure , here it is ...
Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . As we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details .
Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ?
Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ?
I don't think so , why do you ask ?
The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ...
Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . You should give them another call .
