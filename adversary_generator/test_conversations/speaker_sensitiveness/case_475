I would like to know is it a direct flight to Dubai ?
Sorry . No . You need to transfer to a connect flight in the middle .
Too bad . I hate transferring during a flight . It is too complex .
You have to do it . But it takes only about 30 minutes .
Really ? It used to cost a few hours .
It has become more time saving .
Ok . Good . I want two side by side tickets in the Economy cabinet . Thank you .
