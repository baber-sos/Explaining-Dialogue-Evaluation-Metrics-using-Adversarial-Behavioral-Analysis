what's your apartment like ?
it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus .
what is it like living in on-campus housing ?
it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it .
did you have to pay a deposit ?
no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month .
do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?
no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here .
how long is your contract for ?
that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon .
have you started looking again yet ?
