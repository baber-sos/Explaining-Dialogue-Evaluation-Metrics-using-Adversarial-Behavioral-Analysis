do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?
sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ?
I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?
I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ?
I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .
you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the Taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
