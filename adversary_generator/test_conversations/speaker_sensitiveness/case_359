Mr.Wang , we haven't discussed the mode of payment .
You know Mr . Forster , this is a really large purchase . I am afraid we can't pay off at one time . We have to pay by installment .
Do you mean you prefer a deferred payment ?
Yes , Mr.Forester .
When do you start the payment then ?
We'll start our payment in half a year and the total amount will be paid off within 2 years by three installments .
We can accept that but you have to pay the interest .
