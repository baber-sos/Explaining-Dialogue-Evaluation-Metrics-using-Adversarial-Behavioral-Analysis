I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already !
Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top .
An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me .
Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT .
GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ?
Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts
Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ?
Up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . Going to church might help as well !
No matter what I do , I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat !
