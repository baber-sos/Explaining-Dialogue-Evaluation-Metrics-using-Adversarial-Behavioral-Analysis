Hey Mark . What are you doing ?
Just watching some TV .
Anything interesting on ?
Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN .
So I take it you're pretty bored too .
Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ?
It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ?
You wanna shoot some hoops ?
I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy .
Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today .
She's out shopping with her friends .
Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then .
