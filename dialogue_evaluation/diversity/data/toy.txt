Is the shape satisfactory ?
Which about ?
Yes . I ’ m on the Fifth Avenue .
Of course . I went to the gym for a few days .
OK . I can't help it .
What time is the author ?
Well , it's very exciting for you . I have to think about it .
Sure . Here you are .
What time does the next bus leave ?
Let me get it for you .
Ok , do you have a credit card ?
Me , too . You mean a lot to me .
You are welcome to get a promotion of nature .
Let me take a look , it ’ s quite safe , too . Let me just grab my coat . I think I ’ ll find it right , too .
You're welcome .
I don't know what to say .
Ok , I'll get it .
See you .
Fine , sir . Tell me what the problem is .
No . I have no idea .
If it's cheap , you should get used to it .
In special , how much will it cost ?
Yes , it's very useful .
OK .
Have you received my scholarships ?
It's fun .
It's fun .
But you seem to buy a new one .
Not so well , but the mother-in-law is pretty high .
Fine , okay . What should I do ?
Ok , that is a good idea .
If you want me , you ’ ll need to make posters , too .
Do you have any other symptoms ?
If you detect any difference , you ’ ll put it on the scale , right ?
Thank you .
Sightseeing .
Can I help you ?
Sightseeing .
Go and get off at the first Shi Da stop .
Yes , I have lost my driver's license .
Will you be specific pair ?
I don't know . Here it is .
I might think a one of my way .
I'm afraid it will be costly .
I didn't really know that .
Is that right ?
It's impossible .
The watch is cross the line .
I can't believe it .
You are welcome .
You know what they are happier for ?
Well , I am not in the mood for a few days .
Well , wait for a minute .
Well , to be honest , I wouldn't think of that .
All right . Most of the time we have to start eating better .
OK , let's go home and be careful .
It's hard to say . The price of the fruit is pretty high , and the price is pretty high .
As a rule , we have a fairly good fancy , and there are some forbidden activities .
Sure . Meet me at five .
Well , I have a problem , too . Exactly how ?
Just give me a little plan .
They have two cameras .
OK , here you are .

Me , too .
Is that anything you like ?
I just started working for a few days now .
Me too , too . What are you going to do ?
You have to be patient , too .
Well , not really , but we can be carried out well .
I have accumulated a wealth of cigarettes for a few years .
About a week .
You have a bench warrant .
Well , about it . It was a sweet restaurant .
I hope you have a good way .
Me , too . I have to hear the supper for the time .
Me , too . I have to hear the supper for the weekend .
Is that the Customer Service Desk ?
I have English , but I am learning skillfully .
Soda is sad , isn't it ?
Possibly .
To be honest , I am just waiting for the invitation on the invitation . If you want to hear this , the company ’ s too high !
I ’ m glad that we ’ re going to be authentic Mexican food .

That's a great idea .
You are welcome !
Pleased to meet you too , too .
You're welcome !
You are welcome , don't you ?
It's fun .
It's very helpful , people are not sure .
It's very kind of you to say so . But I think the best way to seek money .
I don't think so . I think something must be done .
I told you to say it ’ s the time to relax .
A little before .
Then , you'd better have it delivered to tomorrow .
I have a current tooth .
You have to make a change for the first time . Well , wait a minute .
Sure . But there is a counter at the counter , right ?
Well , wait a lot .
Wait a minute .

Don't worry about it .
Goodbye , wait .
A little before .
Take it to me , please .
We'll have to tell you about our alternatives , please .
Not so well , thank you .
I have been working on that for a long time .
Well , wait a minute .
In example , 5 days now ?
Are you going to have a seat ?
Well , wait a minute .
A little before .
If you detect any difference , I'll take it .
You are attracted to your health .
I have a typical tooth . I don't like it very much .
Sure . The reservation is on the shelf , but I don't really know it .
You're welcome .
I hope to hear you .
Thanks !
It's super .
OK .
Addison .
Ok , that is a little too revealing .
Basically , I feel the same way for you .
Beef , please .
You've come to tell you , huh ?
I have accumulated a current job .
Good .
Exactly .
What's wrong with the fax machine ?
It will be too loud .
Never !

A little juice .
Yes , we will .
Right .
When are you going to see him ?
Yes , but we will handle it .
What are you talking about ?
A little bit .
I really can ’ t bear to help .

I am not sure . I can only carry on a simple conversation in the evenings .
One you are welcome , Miss Wu .

Well , that ’ s not bad .
Not so well , thanks .
That ’ s all right . I ’ m really sorry .
That ’ s all right . I ’ m really sorry .

A little French .
Of course .
It is hard to get upset .
We have a fairly good working relationship , we can handle that .
So what shall we do ?
I need to ?
I have accumulated a wealth of Windows .
I need to ask you a few questions .
I am not sure . What's the difference ?
But wait .
Come in , please .
Forget that anyway .
I don't understand what you mean .
So how have you been ?
So how about the surrounding area ?
Leave me alone .
Which train is the rush ?
I don't understand .
I'm afraid I can't agree , Mr . Farley .
Have you got a sore throat , too ?
