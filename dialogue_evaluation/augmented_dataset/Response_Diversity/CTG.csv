hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank . no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving .

My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . And your parents took it badly ? That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . What do you mean ? Thank you very much .
