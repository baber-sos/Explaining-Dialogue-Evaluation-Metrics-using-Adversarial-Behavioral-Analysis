i have been doing taekwondo since i was a kid , but enjoy softball now
you are very athletic , but i bet that kung fu would not beat my guns
i am not a violent person really . i am in the choir at church !
i attend church sunday faithfully . are you calling me violent ?
i would not fight you , instead i would have you over for italian food
as long as i can bring my family . they live right up the road
you can bring the family . do they like to sing ?
