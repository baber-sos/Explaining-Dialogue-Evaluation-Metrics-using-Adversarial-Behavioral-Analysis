hello , how was your day ?
it was good , i got took a nice hike in the mountains near my house
i have always thought i was too short to go on hikes
nonsense , no ones too short to hike
short people are always having trouble keeping up with taller people
that is the taller persons problem , i am tall and i always try and slow down
well that is nice
