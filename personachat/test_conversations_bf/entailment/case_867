hi , there how are you today ?
i am great . how is the weather ?
not bad at all good day for an adventure , do you travel ?
i love to travel . i like all of the art .
love seeing differences in the world , being law student limits my time though
what is your favorite place
my favorite is home with my girlfriend , but remote mountains are great
the mountains are beautiful . i love the city though .
i think the city is just as rugged , lol . what do you like the most in the city
i love the culture and the outlay of it on a photo
true a city has a culture of there own , but make me feel crowded
are you not comfortable with a lot of people
from a different view , a city is like a busy anthill people crawling everywhere
that is a very poetic way to say that
