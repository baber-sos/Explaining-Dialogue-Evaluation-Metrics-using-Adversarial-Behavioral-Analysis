hello , how is your day going
hi . my day is good . i am hanging out with both of my sons .
cool , sounds like fun . just as much fun as cross stitch and quilts
i love those crafts ! right now i am into my aquarium filled with exotic fish .
i am what you would call a baby boomer , explains the quilting passion
you might like my collection of decorations . they are 50s vintage !
