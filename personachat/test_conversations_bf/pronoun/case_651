very well , thank you . i am getting ready to make dinner . how are you ?
pretty good , just finished up working for the day , looking forward to dinner
what do you do ? i work with horses on my parents ranch .
that sounds like a lot of work , carpentry is my craft . that and super dad of 3
i do not have any children , i am a newly wed .
my wife is awesome , helped me quit drinking 5 years ago already
that is an awesome wife ! my husband is a cop .
she even tolerates me and my buddies playing poker , a cop sounds dangerous
he is heading to las vegas for a police softball tournament tomorrow .
good luck to his team ! do you live in the city or more quite area ?
we are in the country , we live on a 500 acre horse ranch ,
well that sounds safer than a city for sure . i like rural areas .
