i pick things up and put them down . ah the life of a bodybuilder .
i am too old for that . but i try to walk a mile each day !
i have a brother bill . we go for walks sometimes .
that sounds lovely . i have a cat .
i love cats but as a doctor i am too busy for one .
i could not have one when i worked in banking . but now i have retired .
my mom is my secretary at my doctors office , we are super close .
that is so sweet ! i knit things for my children all the time
i wish i knew how to knit .
it is pretty simple , i took a class and now i am a pro !
