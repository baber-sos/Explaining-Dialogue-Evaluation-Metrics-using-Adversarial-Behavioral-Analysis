have you ever seen the sun rise in a small town ?
almost every day of my life , i was born , raised and still live in one .
no kidding me too ! my only complaint is the local schools .
i hear ya ! mine was horrid , thankfully i am in college for web design and coding now .
that is fantastic maybe you could help give me some pointers i am homeschooling my kids .
that has to be a rough job . python for kids is awesome .
i will give it a shot ! what do you like to do ?
drink iced tea and fish . party , hang out with friends .
sounds like a great time my severe allergy to cats keeps me home crafting .
well , i am still young enough to not worry about the long term affects of meds .
how old are you ? are you out of high school ?
i am 22 . still in college .
oh honey when you get a family you will understand much more .
i do understand a lot , lol . i just choose to ignore it . . . for now , lol
