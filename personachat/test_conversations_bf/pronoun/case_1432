hi there , how are you ?
hey i am good how about yourself
good , just got back from the gym ready to hang out alone and kick back .
oh cool you work out often ?
just once a week but i have been trying to stay healthy , drinking nothing but water now
that is awesome i really need to adapt to that type of lifestyle
do you work out at all ?
no not really i use to but its usually too painful
why is that ? i work in the medical field maybe i could help
i have some nerve issues arm and back pains badly
i am a nurse in labor and delivery so maybe i overestimated myself
probably so lol my medical situation is a lot
do you have help at home ? i could not imagine being in that situation myself
i have my boyfriend but he can only help so much since he works
