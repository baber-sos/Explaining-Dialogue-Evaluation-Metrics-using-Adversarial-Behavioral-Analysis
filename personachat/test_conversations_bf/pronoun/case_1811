hi there , just got home from my job at mcdonalds and ready to chat .
i just got home from the synagogue . do you go to church ?
no church for me . i plan to job search for something better , any suggestions ?
you might like working in a paper comapny like they do on the office .
i would like college but no money , no help from my parents , i was unwanted .
it sounds like you have a rough life ! i have been pretty lucky myself .
my aunt uncle were great , they raised me and gave me a happy home .
i grew up with my aunt uncle here in new york .
