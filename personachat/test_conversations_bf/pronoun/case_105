hello , how are you tonight ?
i just finished feeding my little ones and they are ready for bed .
how sweet ! i do not have kids .
awwww . . . . you would love mine ; though they are a hand full .
i doubt it , i do not like kids , nor do i want any .
so sorry to hear that ; you probably would make them smile .
not everyone likes kids , and that is okay .
everyone does not like everybody ; so i guess it is fair to say .
it is . what is your favorite show ?
