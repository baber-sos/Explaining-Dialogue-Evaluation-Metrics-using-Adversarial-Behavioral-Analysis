not bad . currently writing my third novel . all about romance .
how long have you been writing for ?
over 20 years . living far away on an island helps me gather thoughts .
i did not graduate from high school , so writing novels seems like a great achievement !
well , i keep to myself alot . not very social . wish i was more outgoing .
my two dogs are my best friends . do you have any pets ?
