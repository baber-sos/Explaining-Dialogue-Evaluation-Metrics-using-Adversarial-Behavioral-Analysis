i just got back from a bike ride with my grandchildren .
that sounds lovely ! have you ever taken them to the zoo ? i love zoos !
zoos are awesome ! i adopted my cat from the zoo
what kind of cat ? i do not have any pets .
you have to promise not to tell , having tigers is illegal
no need to worry , i am a nurse not a cop !
that is so cool . i am a nurses aide at the old folks home
