hi how are you? i feel woozy . someone must have spiked my iced tea
sorry to hear that . i feel great just finished working out .
i would rather do computer coding than work out . maybe i should change
i exercise daily and ride my horses . do you ride?
no . i like country music festivals, and strumming country songs on my guitar
i am into horses, not much on computers, i grew up on a ranch.
