hello, how is your day going
hi . my day is good . i am hanging out with both of my sons .
cool, sounds like fun . just as much fun as cross stitch and quilts
i love those crafts! right now i am into my aquarium filled with exotic fish .
i am what you would call a baby boomer, explains the quilting passion
you might like my collection of decorations . they are 50s vintage!
sure, it would bring back old memories . especially when my dad served in the military
that is awesome . what do you eat for breakfast? mine is granola every day .
oatmeal fan over here . my parents were immigrants, they raised me on oats everyday .
that is very healthy . i like it . do you eat fish?
yes i do eat fish . i love it
so do i . i just do not eat it in front of my aquarium .
ha ha . . . at least you are considered it of your fish .
i have to be, because it grosses me out to eat them while i watch some swim . lol
