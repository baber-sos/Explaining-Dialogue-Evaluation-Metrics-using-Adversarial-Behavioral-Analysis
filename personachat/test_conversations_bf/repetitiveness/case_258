hi do you have any hobbies? i am a guitarist .
no, i can barely pay my monthly bills .
because i share an apartment with my brothers it is not that expensive .
i teach kindergarten, but i hate children .
that sounds miserable . my other hobby is getting tattoos .
where do you get the tattoos?
i just like them . where do you live?
i live in seattle with two derelicts . they drink all the time .
my brothers and i live in chicago, the folks are from arkansas
do you have a southern accent?
i did have the arkansas accent as a child . why do you live with drunken derelicts?
because my lousy kindergarten salary limits where i can live .
since you hate your job and it pays poorly, why not get another?
