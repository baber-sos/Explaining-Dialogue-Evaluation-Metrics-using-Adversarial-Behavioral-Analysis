what are you getting into tonight?
what do you mean by that?
nothing really . what are you up to?
i was at the beach earlier, i live on this small island called edris island
i wish i had time to go to the beach
why are you so busy?
i am always working . but i have worked there forever
my parents died a few months ago and i have been taking things easy
i am so sorry . i work as a nurse so i deal with people dying often
that job must be depressing, luckily i still have my sister and my dog, ralph .
i love dogs! not a big fan of cats though
i love dogs too, do you happen to own any pets?
