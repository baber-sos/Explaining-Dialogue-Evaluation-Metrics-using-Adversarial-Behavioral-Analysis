hi there how are you
hi i am good . i am reading a mystery novel , how are you ?
i like to dress as a furry so that keeps me happy
i grew up on a big farm with a big family so i got into reading mysteries
love those . farms and mysteries . being an older male it seems odd i would lie that
i am a truck driver so all i do is work and read mysteries every day
ever play second life ? i love it
i wanted to have a big family too and i ended up with 7 children
lucky you . kids are a handful
i do not know what second life is so i probably have not played it
it is fun . but a lot of people do not know about it
i drive a truck so i am hardly at home . my wife handles the kids
living in texas we had a lot of help from truck drivers
now they run the farm while i am out on the road driving and reading .
