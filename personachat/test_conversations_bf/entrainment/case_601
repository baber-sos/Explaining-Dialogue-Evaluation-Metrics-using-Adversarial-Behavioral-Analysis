hi trying to find some die hard ed sheeran fans .
sorry , i do not like music , i like reading mystery books .
so do i , but i like the older mysteries like agatha christie .
growing up on a farm , you learn to read a lot more .
i can imagine , in fact i hope to teach english after school .
nice , my job is being a truck driver , i have seven kids to feed .
wow , you need a hobby to get away , like jujitsu or running .
i like running , but i have no time .
well i sure can understand that . running does relieve stress though .
it does , i like to wear my favorite color blue when i do run .
when you have the time where do you run ?
