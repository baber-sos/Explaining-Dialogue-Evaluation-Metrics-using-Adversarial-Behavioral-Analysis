i am doing well . i just took a break from writing my new novel .
what is your novel about ? i am a recent college graduate
it is actually a romance novel , but it has sci fi elements .
that sounds interesting , i would like to read it some day .
it should be out by the end of the year . do you have any pets ?
i do ! my beloved cat arizona . do you ?
i have some cats as well . two of them . they keep me company since i am isolated .
why are you isolated ? do you have siblings ? my brother was just married
i live on an island near greece . so i am introverted , but by location not personality .
