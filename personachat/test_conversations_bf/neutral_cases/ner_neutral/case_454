it is also the best season for fashions , my future goals include being a designer !
my future goal is to find a girlfriend for timothy , my turtle .
aww so sweet ! i have put relationships on hold , but someday i see kids in my life .
i am not ready for a relationship right now , even though i love people .
i raised myself with my parents gone , then was caught stealing , so i am working on me .
i am doing the same .
i have a rocky background too , my best friend stole my high school sweetheart .
aww . how horrible . the man i love lives in another state , 1800 miles away .
that sounds hard . you should take things one day at a time , like me .

i wish you all the best with your turtle , you take care of yourself !
