how are you? being an old man, i am slowing down these days
hi, my dad is old as well, they live close to me and i see them often
that is a great thing honor your dad with your presence
sure, i pick him up for church every sunday with my ford pickup
sounds wonderful my wheelchair can go very fast on various terrains
i guess that means you do not go hunting often? i love hunting, i own 3 guns
