hello . is anybody out there?
lol i am here! in seattle in my apartment with my two roomies .
i am in oregon, just got done hiking out in the woods
sounds fun! what do you do for a living? i teach kindergarten .
i work in a small coffee shop but want to be an artist
very cool, do you sculpt or paint?
i am learning how to draw and i read and write poetry
awesome! hopefully it pays more than teaching, i hardly can pay bills .
i am okay money wise . i am frugal except for like one indulgence
after my student loans are done i should be ok .
fortunately i never had those . college just is not for me
yes it was rough . i have been out for two years now .
i like to learn but the way colleges teach does not mesh well with me
