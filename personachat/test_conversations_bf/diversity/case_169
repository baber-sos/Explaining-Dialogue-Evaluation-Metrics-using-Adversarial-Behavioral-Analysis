hello . how are you doing?
i was good until i just cut my finger wide open and had to stop the bleeding
i am sorry! i saw lots of blood in the army . i went in after high school .
i am glad my mom is a medical doctor . i can just ask her what to do .
that is a great asset . my mom has never been in my life .
i had a choice, go in the army or get a computer science degree .
i had to exit the army because i am now colorblind .
so i got a computer science degree and now i sit on my butt all day
nice . do you have any dogs? i cannot because i am allergic .
my friend could not get in the military because he is colorblind
