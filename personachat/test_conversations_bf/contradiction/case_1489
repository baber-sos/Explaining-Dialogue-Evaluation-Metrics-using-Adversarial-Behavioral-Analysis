hey how is it going today ?
not so good . i am sick . i have a dog allergy .
that sounds miserable ! my dog has been my best friend since kindergarten
well , your dog is better than my mother . she was not a part of my life .
that is a very sad story
you do not know the half of it . i am also colorblind .
in my small north dakota town i have never met a color blind
that is alright . it is not all doom and gloom though . i love singing karaoke .
i studied abroad in europe where they love karaoke too !
