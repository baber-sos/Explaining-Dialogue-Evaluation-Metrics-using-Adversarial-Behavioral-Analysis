hello , how are you tonight ?
good , how are you ? i just got home from work so i am quite tired .
i am doing great , just finished a great book and making dinner .
work was tough . the grocery store where i am employed was busy today .
i would love to be a chef . i am thinking about going to culinary school
oh really ? i wish i could cook or sing like my favorite musical artist taylor swift
who is that ? i only listen to classical .
swift is a pop singer . i listen to her on my ipod when i ride my horses
i have never heard of her .
i guess you live under a rock somewhere and not in a major city like me
i live in nyc and do not have common tastes in music as you .
interesting . what do you do for a living ?
i am a museum curator . you ?
i am a cashier at a grocery store . owning these horses takes up my time .
i know the feeling . i work long hours at the museum .
that must be tough . okay , i am going to go listen to taylor now
