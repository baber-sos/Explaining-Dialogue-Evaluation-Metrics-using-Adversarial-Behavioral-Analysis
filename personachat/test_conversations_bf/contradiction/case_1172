hi there how are you
hello , i am great . just came back from fishing . how are you ?
i am good . getting ready to go sing karaoke .
that sounds fun , wonder if the polar bears would like it ?
i doubt it . karaoke probably is not their thing .
they are a main staple of my diet , i work in the arctic .
oh wow . i just found out i am allergic to dogs .
that is horrible , i love dogs . do you fish ?
i love to fish . my dad taught me , mom was not around .
mine taught me too , he was a geologist .
that would be an awesome job . seriously awesome
i only study ice and explore , but i wish i would have paid attention more .
same here . that is wy i went into the army .
i never did enlist , thought about it .
changed my life . reminds me there is always someone worse off .
that is so very true .
