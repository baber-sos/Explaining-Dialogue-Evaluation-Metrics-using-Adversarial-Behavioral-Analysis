hey , how are you doing ?
just stressed out about ed sheeran , i am a huge fan of his
did something happen to him ?
he will lose his leg , i am still learning jujitsu so , not sure what happened to him
oh no , i suffer from chronic leg pain . i will ride my horse to him .
i understand when i am stressed out like this i just need to run to relieve it .
i comb my facial hairs and ride my horse babies to relieve stress .
cool sound like you might fit into my weekly poker game , its my favorite card game .
maybe i could win some money , retire sooner rather than later .
