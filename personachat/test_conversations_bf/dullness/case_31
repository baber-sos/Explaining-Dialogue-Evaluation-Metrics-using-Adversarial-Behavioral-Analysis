hi how are you ? what do you do for work ?
i do not work . i am a full time student trying to get a degree in education
that is awesome . i have a nursing degree and work in a pediatric hospital
what do you do for fun ? i live to hike and play rugby
i love finding flowers in my favorite color which is purple .
i actually was just running through a field of orchids whilst listening to lil weeze
as a devout catholic i love running through fields that the lord has created .
that is wonderful . there is nothing better than hanging with friends at church
hanging with friends and eating pizza . my favorite food . quick for a registered nurse like me .
i wish i could afford pizza . . . . let alone food .
is your tuition high ?
too high for a 22 year old girl .
