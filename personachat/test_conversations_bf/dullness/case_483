hello ? i have not had a lot of interaction lately .
hi there ! do you live alone ?
i do , pretty faraway . on an island . alone .
it is hard to enjoy when there is no one to share it with .
i share it with my characters that i write about .
it is nice to have a hobby like that , i like to sing in a choir .
you must have a nice voice . it is not my hobby though . my hobby is cat training .
if i sing badly , my friends drown my voice out , haha !
lol , do you read ? anything specific ?
not really . i spend my free time playing softball . and eating !
wow ! sounds great ! i am rethinking the whole deserted island thing .
