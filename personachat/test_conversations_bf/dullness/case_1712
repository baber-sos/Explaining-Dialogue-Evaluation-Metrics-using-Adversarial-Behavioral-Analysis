hi how are you ? i feel woozy . someone must have spiked my iced tea
sorry to hear that . i feel great just finished working out .
i would rather do computer coding than work out . maybe i should change
i exercise daily and ride my horses . do you ride ?
no . i like country music festivals , and strumming country songs on my guitar
i am into horses , not much on computers , i grew up on a ranch .
i plan to spend my early twenties on a ranch .
cool , i like music by john denver , we ranchers like the country stuff .
true . maybe i will build a website for country music fans . kind of like spotify
computer novice here , but i garden ? i use my garden vegetables in my cooking .
