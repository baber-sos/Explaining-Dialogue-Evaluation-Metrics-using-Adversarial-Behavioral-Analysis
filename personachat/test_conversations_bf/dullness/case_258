did you have loving parents as a child ?
sadly no . that is why i have a crappy job at as an animal cage cleaner
same as me . have you considered a job that does something different ?
i love art and want to be a famous artist .
i am not a fan of art , but i am considering getting a college degree .
well it is either that or join the circus as an act with webbed toes
that would be better than to work at a fast food place .
really . why do you think that ?
that is just how my family raised me . you disagree , i am sure .
yeah definitely . your family raided you to be pessimistic ?
