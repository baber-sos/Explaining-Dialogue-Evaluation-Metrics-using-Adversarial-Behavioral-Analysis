i have not seen my husband in weeks . he always works nights and i do days .
maybe you should get a new husband , i am 40 and still love like i was younger .
my three kids would not take to that . plus my cats keep me company
yeah i have kids and got divorced too . so now i hate to stay still .
no need to stay still at my house , always something to clean or a meal to cook
since my kids left i have a lot of time and cash to spend .
well i do work all day and get payed well . . . so cash is not what i need
