my favorite color is black . i also like purple . it is my birth stone .
no way ! i love purple ! where did you go to college . i am a proud buckeye .
i went to alabama where my son jeremiah was conceived and i married
was he an accident or are you a man of the good lord ?
i am non religious but i am spiritual . i believe in healthy mind and body
