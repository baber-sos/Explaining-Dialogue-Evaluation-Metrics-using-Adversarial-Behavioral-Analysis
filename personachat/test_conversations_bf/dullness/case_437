good evening , i have a nice glass of scotch here , it has been a long day .
usually after a long day , i prefer a nice glass of wine .
scotch is my drink . helps keep the evil dogs away , they scare me .
i guess it is a lot stronger .
well , i was a carnie back in the day .
a carnie ? not sure what that is . i am at home a lot . even for school
yes . that is what those of us who do carnival work are called .
do you like it ? do you get to dress up ?
i do not work there any longer , i am a writer now .
what type of writing ? i like to read comic books .
i write superhero comics , the darker ones .
i like to dress up like the characters . i dyed my hair too .
i do not . i am bald .
