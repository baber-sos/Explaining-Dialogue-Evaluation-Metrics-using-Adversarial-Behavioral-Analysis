lets make this quick and painless . i have no friends .
that is okay , i am recently divorces so i am lonely .
sorry to hear that . i used to drink a lot . that was a lonely time for me .
i used to drink to get away from my wife , she caused problems .
i do have a small family , but i like to play poker . it is a silent game .
i am terrible at poker because i do not like to sit still .
i am a bit of a carpenter , so it is the opposite of what i am used to .
how long have you been a carpenter ?
five years and counting . i am not too fond of it though .
why not , it seems like a very reputable thing .
very tedious work . i find repetition to be boring . same jobs . same routine .
i guess so , are you not allowed to be creative in your work ?
depends on the person the job is for .
