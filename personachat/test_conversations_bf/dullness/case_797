hello , how are you today ? i just got in from riding my horse .
i am good . just reading a nice romance about a girl who loves a ghost
that sounds interesting . i love reading books on the beach .
i usually read while i am eating pizza from my moms restaurant
oh man , i miss pizza so much ! i am dieting right now , it is rough !
eating is my life ! i could never diet
lucky you ! i spend so much time on the beach , i want to look good .
i wish i could go to the beach . i get nervous and stutter around attractive people though
my brother stuttered , but he was able to overcome it . maybe you can too .
i really hope i can
horseback riding helped him learn confidence , which helped his stutter . maybe you can try that ? .
thank you for the idea . i will talk to my mom at work tonight

That question does not make sense to me.
