i hate all animals to be honest
i see . i like most animals , i grew up on a farm .
dropping out of high school was a bad idea . the landlord just called .
my landlord is my dad . we do not really get along .
lucky , he can give you slack .
he makes me cry as bad as onions do . but i truly enjoy onions .
not running is what makes me cry like a baby
i like to run as well . i did about 3 miles today .
i just did 15 miles .
i wish i had time for 15 , but my job takes too much of my time .
