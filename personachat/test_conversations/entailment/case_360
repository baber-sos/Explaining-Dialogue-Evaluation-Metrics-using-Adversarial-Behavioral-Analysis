do you like living that life style ?
i just got into it because my friends did . we hang out and play second life .
is that still a thing ? wow .
yeah , it is not as popular as it used to be .
that really brings back memories .
i wish they would come out with a new version . it looks very dated .
i have not been on that in years .
