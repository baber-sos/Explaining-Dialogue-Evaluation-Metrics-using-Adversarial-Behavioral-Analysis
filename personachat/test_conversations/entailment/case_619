i bet you have some crazy stories though .
the worst was when i treated a lady dressed like a cat . cats repulse me
i am not a cat lover either . i would rather deal with dogs .
my dad has 5 dogs and i do not enjoy him so dogs bother me too
i went to a friends wedding last week where they used their dog as a ring barer
haha that is silly . at least it was not a disgusting cat
very true . do you have a favorite band you like to listen to while working ?
i cannot listen to music while working since nurses have to listen to patients . you ?
