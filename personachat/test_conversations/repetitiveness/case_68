bad, i am broke and my low income apartment has rent due tomorrow
i know that feeling . i have been stuck at the same low paying job for years .
same here, fast food does not pay like how i thought it did at 16
at 16, i had a job taking care of cats, but now i really hate them .
i hate all animals to be honest
i see . i like most animals, i grew up on a farm .
dropping out of high school was a bad idea . the landlord just called.
