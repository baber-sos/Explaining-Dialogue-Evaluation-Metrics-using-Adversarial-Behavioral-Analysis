as a doctor i should know to eat less bacon but it is just so god
that is true . i am studying to become a fashion designer .
so cool! since i am into bodybuilding i do not wear many clothes
i lifted weights in prison . i did some time for stealing .
oh so did my brother . my secretary mom was so upset about it
my parents do not care about me . they are hardly ever around .
i am sorry to hear that . do you have any siblings or kids?
i would love to be a mom but i am trying to turn my life around .
good luck! i have seen many success stories in my work as a doctor
thank you . do you have any children?
i do not . too busy bodybuilding and working at the doctors office
being a doctor is very important . are you a specialist?
i am a general practitioner
you must see a lot of different people and ailments.
