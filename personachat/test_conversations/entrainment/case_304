hello there my new friend
hello , what have you been doing ?
well lately i have been getting ready for ski season up on the mountain
how exciting , i just got home from walking my dog
that is awesome ! i have two dogs and some cats , how do you feel about cats
i like them , but i only have a dog , because my sister is allergic to cats .
that kinda sucks , cats can be a handful but i still love them
