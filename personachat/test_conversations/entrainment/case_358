i like music to relax . but mostly to read
i like to read ! and run after a day of caring for kids .
what do you like to read ? i like biographies
mostly medical journals . oh , and vintage cars . i love them .
i like to cook . it is a challenge to cook something my son will eat
between my marriage , my practice and my own 2 kids , i do not cook often .
i guess that means a lot pizza
yeah ! but as a pediatrician , i do like to sneak in the veggies and fruit !
that usually requires bribing my son with extra screen time
not too much of that ! its not good for them !
well i have learned to pick my battles
that is true , too . i do that with my husband !
ha . yeah with my husband i bribe him with extra dessert
i wanted to buy another vintage car so i had to bribe him as well !
