gotcha . i had to have a tail removed when i was born .
well , i am what is known as a furry , and i would love to have a tail .
do you like living that life style ?
i just got into it because my friends did . we hang out and play second life .
is that still a thing ? wow .
yeah , it is not as popular as it used to be .
that really brings back memories .
i wish they would come out with a new version . it looks very dated .
i have not been on that in years .
you are not missing too much .
is it still the same old costumes and skins ?
pretty much . but some people have gotten really creative with it .
i bet they have . i always thought it was too slow .
