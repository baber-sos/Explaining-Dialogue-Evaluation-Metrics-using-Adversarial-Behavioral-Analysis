how is this lovely evening treating you ?
it is awesome . how are you ?
doing well , feet a little tired after showing 4 houses in the last 2 hours !
that does sound exhausting ! i have been outside with my brothers shoveling the driveway !
snow will be the death of me ! wish i could move back to mississippi
i have never been there ! i love the snow though . it keeps me happy and busy .
i prefer greenery . and living green !
i would not trade the snow for anything . i love winter time .
do you have any interests besides snow ?
well , i have a simple job . but i do like some hard rock .
yeah , who is your favorite artist ?
i recently got a guitar signed by metallica , so i really like metallica , obviously .
lars is the best ! the endurance of drummers , right ?
