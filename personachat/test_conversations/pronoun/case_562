no kidding me too ! my only complaint is the local schools .
i hear ya ! mine was horrid , thankfully i am in college for web design and coding now .
that is fantastic maybe you could help give me some pointers i am homeschooling my kids .
that has to be a rough job . python for kids is awesome .
i will give it a shot ! what do you like to do ?
drink iced tea and fish . party , hang out with friends .
sounds like a great time my severe allergy to cats keeps me home crafting .
well , i am still young enough to not worry about the long term affects of meds .
how old are you ? are you out of high school ?
