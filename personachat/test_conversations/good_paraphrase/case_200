hi ! how are you doing today ?
i am sad . my parents were never around when i was young .
i am sorry . sometimes it is better . did you have foster kids
no . i want kids though . just not yet .
are you in college ? that is a good plan
yes but i am mad . becky stole my boyfriend .
if he was that easy to run with another woman he was not worth it .
what would you be if you could be anything ?
rich lol . i am retired on a budget
i would be a fashion designer but i have a criminal record .
you can still get a degree in it and make your line
life is half full for you .
there is always a window when a door closes . just what i have lived by
but should you be breaking into all of these houses ?
