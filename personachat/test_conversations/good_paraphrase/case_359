lol . i write novels , mainly romance . my cats always make an appearance .
interesting , how does it pay ?
it pays for the extra . my husband is a detective .
maybe i should try that , seattle is not cheap for kindergarten teachers
i live on an island in the caribbean . it suits us .
cool , i have a college friend who worked in the caribbean one summer
it is a different world here , i would not change it for anything .
that would be nice , ramen gets tiresome after day four
i have never ate it . what is it ?
