i have been doing taekwondo since i was a kid , but enjoy softball now
you are very athletic , but i bet that kung fu would not beat my guns
i am not a violent person really . i am in the choir at church !
i attend church sunday faithfully . are you calling me violent ?
i would not fight you , instead i would have you over for italian food
as long as i can bring my family . they live right up the road
you can bring the family . do they like to sing ?
yes . we can also talk about the second ammendment and how you should not fear guns
lets get a my family against your family softball game going
that sounds like a lot of fun if i do say so m
you cannot beat home made italian food and a big game of sports
no you surely cannot . what else can you cook ?
i know how to make a delicious bowl of captain crunch
well that is a coincidence because i happen to love captain crunch
in that case , i will keep the crunch berries and you can keep the gold things
