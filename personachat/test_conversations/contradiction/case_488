that sounds interesting . i collect decorations from the 50s . do you like cars from that era ?
i do , but mostly i like ginger , my retriever now . tell me more about you
i am going to school to be a hairdresser . i really like it .
i cannot imagine doing that , i mostly just play with cars and watch titanic
and have a wonderful new pal in ginger ! i just have exotic fish .
fishes are cool too . i just wish they did more than swim and eat !
sometimes , i do , too , but the boys are enough like animals sometimes .
