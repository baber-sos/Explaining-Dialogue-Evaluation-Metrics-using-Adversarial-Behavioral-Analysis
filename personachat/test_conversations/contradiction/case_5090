hi , how are you tonight ?
doing pretty good . spent most the night at church . you ?
i was home knitting things for kids in the hospital
well that is just too sweet . how did you get involved in that ?
i am disabled so i can not work but wanted to do something meaningful
that is such a touching story . most people would not be as generous as you .
i like to think it is still good people . what do you do ?
me too ! i help build houses . it is a family business .
awesome ! ! ! i would love a wheelchair accessible house
really ? i have built a couple of those myself . not difficult at all !
i love to cook so i would like a lower countertop and stove
those actually are not too hard to accommodate for and can be cost effective sometimes .
you make it sound so simple lol
it is what i do every day . except sundays . that day is for the lord .
absolutely . the lord deserves his time .
i agree . things would be a lot better in this country if people put god first .
yes . god is able to do great things for people who have faith .
so true ! what else do you do in your spare time other than knit ?
cook and read various novels
wish i had the time for that . sounds relaxing .
it is but you can spare a few minutes and read a chapter a day
that is true . i do feel guilty for not reading the bible often . .
