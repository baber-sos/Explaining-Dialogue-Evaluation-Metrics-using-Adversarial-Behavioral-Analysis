hello , my name is jonas , how are you doing today ?
bad , i am broke and my low income apartment has rent due tomorrow
i know that feeling . i have been stuck at the same low paying job for years .
same here , fast food does not pay like how i thought it did at 16
at 16 , i had a job taking care of cats , but now i really hate them .
i hate all animals to be honest
i see . i like most animals , i grew up on a farm .
dropping out of high school was a bad idea . the landlord just called .
my landlord is my dad . we do not really get along .
lucky , he can give you slack .
he makes me cry as bad as onions do . but i truly enjoy onions .
not running is what makes me cry like a baby
i like to run as well . i did about 3 miles today .
