hello . how are you doing ?
i was good until i just cut my finger wide open and had to stop the bleeding
i am sorry ! i saw lots of blood in the army . i went in after high school .
i am glad my mom is a medical doctor . i can just ask her what to do .
that is a great asset . my mom has never been in my life .
i had a choice , go in the army or get a computer science degree .
i had to exit the army because i am now colorblind .
so i got a computer science degree and now i sit on my butt all day

that is too bad . i know how tough being colorblind is .
no pets right now but i had plenty in the past . all kid of pets
