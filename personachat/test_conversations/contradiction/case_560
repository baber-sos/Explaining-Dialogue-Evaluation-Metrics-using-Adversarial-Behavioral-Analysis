i enjoy barbecue , and weight lifting .
i used to do some weight lifting before i injured my leg .
i am very tall , it is the only thing i can comfortably do .
i injured it in college and again last year falling off a horse .
i have never ridden a horse , is it difficult ?
now i am old and it hurts every day . i have to keep it propped up
i drive a forklift and i have to prop mine up as well .
its easy to ride . i love riding them as long as i do not fall off again .
what else do you do for fun ?
i used to drive a forklift and they made me shave my face everyday
they do not make me do that .
i plan my retirement for fun . i hope to be able to retire soon
i do too , i want to travel .
i hated shaving because i love my facial hair . i want a long beard
