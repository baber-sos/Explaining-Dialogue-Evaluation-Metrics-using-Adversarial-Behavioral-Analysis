I'm looking for a moderately priced place to eat that's in the centre of town.
What type of cuisine are you looking for? There are 21 restaurants in that area.
I don't have a preference.
Out of the 21 restaurant choices, one is the Yippee Noodle Bar which is moderately priced in the centre of town. Would you like to make a reservation?
That sounds great, what is the postcode?
Their postcode is cb11lh and if you want a reservation just let me know the time, party size, and day and I'll make it for you.
Not now, thanks. Here's a weird one, though - are there any expensive 0-star hotels in the center of town?
I'm sorry, but there are no expensive 0-star hotels in the area. Can I help you find something else?
Do you have a hotel in the moderate price range?
The Cityroomz Hotel is moderatly priced, and has free internet and parking. Would you like to make a reservation now?
That sounds nice, yes please book a room for 3 guests staying for 5 nights starting on Sunday.
I'm sorry, those particular dates are filled, if you'd like I could try to make the trip shorter or maybe change days?
How about just for the one night?
Alright, I was able to book your hotel room at the Cityroomz, for 3 people, for one night. Your reference number is E62IXZGB . Is there anything else I can do?
