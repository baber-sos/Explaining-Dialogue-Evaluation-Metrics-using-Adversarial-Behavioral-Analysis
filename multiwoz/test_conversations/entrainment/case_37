Hello! I am looking for train schedules from Leicester. Can you help me with that?
Sure! There are several trains leaving from leicester. What destination, day and time would you like me to search?
I like a train going to cambridge on tuesday please.
Okay. It looks as if there are trains leaving Leicester for Cambridge every hour starting at 5:09 and ending at 23:09 on Tuesday.
Pick one. I need the travel time and arrival time. Any one after 20:15.
You have one leaving at 21:09, what time do you want to arrive by?
