Can you find me a train going to Cambridge on Sunday?
What departure site were you interested in?
I am looking to depart from bishops stortford and need to arrive by 13:15.
I have four trains leaving from bishops stortford on Sunday. The last one arrives in Cambridge at 12:07. Would you like to book?
I think so. How much is that train? And can you tell me the travel time?
The cost is 8.08 GBP per ticket, and the travel time is 38 minutes.
Thanks. I'm also wondering what kind of information you have on Pizza Express.
