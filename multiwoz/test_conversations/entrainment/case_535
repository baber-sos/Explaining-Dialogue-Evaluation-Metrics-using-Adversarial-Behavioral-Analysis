I am looking for a theatre to visit while in Cambridge. Preferably one in the centre of town.
Would you like to try the cambridge arts theatre?
That sounds great! could you tell me how much the entrance fee would cost?
Unfortunately I do not have that information in my system. I could give you their phone number, though, if you like.
Could you please find the entrance fee for me? I am unable to make the phone call right now.
