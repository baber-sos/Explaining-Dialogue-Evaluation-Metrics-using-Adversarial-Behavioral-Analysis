Hi, I want to travel to Cambridge by train.
Great, what time do you have in mind?
I want to arrive by 17:30.
And where are you leaving from?
I'm leaving from Broxbourne on Sunday.
The first train departs Broxbourne for Cambridge on Sunday at 05:32. Do you want to purchase this ticket or pick a later departure time?
