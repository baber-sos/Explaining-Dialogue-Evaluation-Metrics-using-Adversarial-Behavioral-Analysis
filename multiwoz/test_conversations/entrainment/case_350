Hello, I'm trying to find a train to take me to London Kings Cross from Cambridge, are there any on that route?
We have many trains departing Cambridge for London Kings Cross, is there a particular day you are wanting to travel?
I want to leave on Saturday.
Thanks! Do you have a particular time you want to leave or arrive?
