Hello, I'm looking for information on the Alpha-Milton guest house.
The alpha-milton guesthouse is in the north area, moderately priced, showing 3 stars. There is no internet or parking. Should I book this for you?
Yes, please book 3 nights at the alpha-milton guesthouse for me. I would like to check in on wednesday.
For how many people?
Actually, I don't need a reservation. I am looking for a modern european restaurant in the center of town, though.
The Riverside Brasserie is good and is located at the Doubletree by Hilton. Can I reserve a table for you?
can i get the address, phone number, and price range please?
No problem. The address is Doubletree by Hilton Cambridge Granta Place Mill Lane. The phone number is 01223259988. It is in moderate price range.
Can you book a table for 2 at 7 pm tomorrow night?
Sure, just to confirm you need that for 2 people?
