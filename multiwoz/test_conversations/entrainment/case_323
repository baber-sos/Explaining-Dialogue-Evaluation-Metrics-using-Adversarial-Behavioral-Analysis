I am looking for a restaurant in the west part of town.
What type of food are you looking for and what price range?
I am looking for a restaurant in the moderate price range and the food type for those restaurants.
British, Indian, or Italian.
Indian. And can you find me something to do afterwards in the same area of town?
Meghna is a restaurant in the west serving indian food in the moderate price range. Do you need more information or want to reserve a table?
I'd just like the address for now, thanks. Are there any attractions in the west part of town?
The address is 205 Victoria Road Chesterton. Anything else I can do for you?
Could be please call a cab?
I'd be happy to help you with a taxi, what is your destination/departure and what time would you like to arrive/leave?
Nevermind, I actually don't need one.
There are 13 attractions in the west area of town. Would you like more information?
