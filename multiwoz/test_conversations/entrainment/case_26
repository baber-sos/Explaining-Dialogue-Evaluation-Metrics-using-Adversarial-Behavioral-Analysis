I am coming to Cambridge and would like to see some architecture. Do you have any located in the centre?
Yes, there are 5 places located in the centre. I recommend the All Saints Church on Jesus Lane.
Thanks! What's the entrance fee?
There is no entrance fee, it is free. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I'd like to find a guesthouse to stay at. I want it to be nice, so I'd like an expensive one.
It seems like all of my guesthouses are in different price ranges. No expensive ones are listed. Can I interest you in a different price range?
Well then I need a hotel that has free parking and a 4 star rating.
I've found three hotels matching your preferences. The University Arms Hotel is in the expensive price range and is located in the centre of town if you are interested.
I would like a guesthouse in the moderate price range that has 4 stars and includes free parking.
