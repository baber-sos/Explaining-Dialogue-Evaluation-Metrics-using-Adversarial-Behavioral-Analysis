Hi I am hoping to find a place that is expensive I can stay at, and also has free wifi.
University Arms Hotel near centre is a 4 star with internet on Regent Street. Phone is 01223351241.
Can you find me one with a 3 star rating?
The Gonville Hotel is in the center. The have free internet and parking. their number is 01223366611.
I'd like to book this for 2 people, 3 nights starting on Tuesday please.
Ok I was able to get this for you. Reference number is 2RAB8AMP . Are you looking for places to go as well? I can help with that too.
Yes can you please assist with entertainment?
What type of attraction?
I apologize, I wasn't paying attention to what I wanted. Can you help me find a modern eclectic restaurant in the centre?
Unfortunately, I don't have any modern eclectic restaurants in the city. Is there another type of restaurant I can look for?
Hmm, is there none at all? Eclectic food?
No, I'm sorry. Want to try a different food type?
