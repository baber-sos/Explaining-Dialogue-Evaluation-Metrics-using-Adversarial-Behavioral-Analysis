I need you to find a hotel so I have a place to stay. It doesn't need to include internet, but it should include free parking.
I like acorn guest house. Need me to book a room?
Can you tell me more about the Acorn guest house before we look at booking. I'm looking for a moderately priced room and some other amenities.
The Acorn has parking and free wifi. It's in the North part of town at 154 Chesterton Rd. It's a 4 star guesthouse.
Do you have anything that has a 3 star rating?
I have 3 guesthouses that are in moderate price range with 3 star ratings, do you have a location preference?
Yes, I would like to stay in the centre please.
I don't have anything in that area. Can I look somewhere else?
I don't have a preference in what area of town.
I can recommend the hamilton house in the north. Would you like to make a booking?
Do they have free wifi, I was really looking for a hotel rather than a guesthouse though.
