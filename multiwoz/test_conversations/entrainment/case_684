I am going to Cambridge and need a place to eat that serves lebanese food and is cheaply priced.
Unfortunately there are no Lebanese restaurants in the cheap price range. Would you like another cuisine type or price range?
What kind of cheap restaurants are there in the center of town?
I'm sorry, there are none. Would you like to change your cuisine type or location?
how about one that serves indian food?
I found three cheap indian restaurants in the centre. Would you like to book at Mahal of Cambridge?
That sounds great. I need a table for 6 at 16:30 on Saturday, please. And I will need the reference number once it's booked.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Your reference number is ZCRT70X4 . Can I help with anything else?
