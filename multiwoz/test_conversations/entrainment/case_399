Hello, I would like some information about a restaurant in Cambridge called Bedouin. Can you find out if they are taking reservations for me?
That is an African restaurant in the center of town. It is in the expensive price range .Any other information you need?
Can I have the address and postcode please?
The address for Bedouin is 100 Mill Road City Centre. The post code is cb12bd. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I actually need some places to go in the centre area.
There are many options for attractions in the centre area, are you interested in architecture, colleges, boating, theatres or museums?
I am interested in colleges
How about christ's college?
That would be fine. Can I get the address and phone number.
Sure the address is saint andrew's street and the phone number is 01223334900.
