Are there any Modern European restaurants in the centre?
There are 4 available. Do you want to specify a price range?
Yes, I would like something in the expensive price range, please.
Darrys cookhouse and wine shop is the only expensive modern european restaurant. Do you want me to book it for you?
That would be great. Could you book me a table for 4 on monday at 19:45?
Your reservation is set, your reference number is EOMCTSEA
Great, thank you. Can you also help me find a train departing from bishops stortford for the same day?
Sure thing! Is there a particular time you'd like to leave or arrive by?
I would like to arrive in Cambridge by 15:00, please.
