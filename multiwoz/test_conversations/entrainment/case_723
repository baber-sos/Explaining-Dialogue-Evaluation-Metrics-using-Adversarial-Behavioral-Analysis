I need a train leaving King's Lynn after 13:45.
What day will you be traveling?
This will be for wednesday.
There is TR9057 Which is at 9.80 pounds and takes 47 minutes. will you book that?
No that won't be necessary. Can you just tell me what the arrival time is?
No train leaving kings lynn at 13.45. Do you want to change the departure time?
I can leave any time after 13:45 going to Cambridge. Will you check the schedule again, please?
Sorry, there are actually 10 entries here. Shall I book one for you?
Just the first departure after 13:45 please, no booking, just the price and arrival time.
TR8143 will cost 9.80 pounds and arrives by 14:58. Anything else I can do for you?
I also need to find a place to stay.
What area of town would you like to be in?
It doesnt matter. I just want it to be a cheap guesthouse with wifi included.
I can recommend the Allenbell. It's in the east, is cheap yet has a 4 star rating and free wifi and parking. Can I help you book?
No I just need the phone number. Thanks
Their phone number is 01223210353. Is there anything else I can help with?
