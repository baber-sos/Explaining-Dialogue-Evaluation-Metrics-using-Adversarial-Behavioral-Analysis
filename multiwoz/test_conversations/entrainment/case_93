I'm looking for an expensive restaurant that serves Thai food, please.
There is one in the west and one in the centre of town. Do you have a preference in area?
I don't have a preference in the area. I suppose you could book me a table for two people at 12:30 on Saturday. Also, could i get the reference number?
