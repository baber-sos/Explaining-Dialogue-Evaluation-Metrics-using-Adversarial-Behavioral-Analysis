Great, we are meeting friends at wandlebury country park before we eat, can you tell me about that place and where it is?
Wandlebury is a lovely park on the south side. Their address is quite the mouthful: Wandlebury Ring, Gog Magog Hills, Babraham.
Okay thank you very much.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I will need a taxi to get from the park to the restaurant.
