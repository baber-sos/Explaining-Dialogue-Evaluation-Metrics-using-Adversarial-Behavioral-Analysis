I'm looking for a place to stay. I want to make sure it is 4 stars and includes free parking. Can you help with this?
Of course! There are 19 places that fit that description. Is there an area or price range that you prefer?
I would prefer something moderately priced in the centre of town
Unfortunately, I don't see anything that fits your needs. Would you like me to try another area?
Hmm, yes I suppose I could try one on the north side of town. Are there any?
Yes, there is a total of 6 places to stay in the North side of town. Would you like me to book you into one?
Yes please, whichever you prefer.
OK. I can do that for you. I need number of people, length of stay, and day of arrival.
Actually, I don't think I'm ready to make a reservation just yet. Does the location on the north side of town have 4 stars, free parking, and moderate prices?
Yes, there are 6 places that will meet your needs. I suggest the Kirkwood House. Would you like any more information about it?
Just the postcode please.
The postcode for Kirkwood House is cb41da. Is there anything else I can help you with?
