I'm looking for some type of entertainment in the centre of town, can you tell me what is available?
Can you be more specific? There's a lot of different things to do, like restaurants, shows, clubs...
Are there any museums?
There are 11 museums in centre, all with free admission. What type of museum would you like to visit?
Any of those museums will work. Will you select one for me? I need their phone number, please.
