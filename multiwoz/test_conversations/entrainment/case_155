Hi, can you help me plan my Cambridge trip? I need a train from London Kings Cross to Cambridge.
I can help you with that. One leaves friday at 05:17, is that time okay for you?
Actually, I need to leave Tuesday after 10:30.
I have a train that leaves Tuesday at 11:17 that will arrive at 12:08. Would you like to make a reservation?
Yes, please make a reservation for 6 people. I'll need the reference number.
I was able to book your train. Your reference number is F13RS8CP . Is there anything else that you need?
