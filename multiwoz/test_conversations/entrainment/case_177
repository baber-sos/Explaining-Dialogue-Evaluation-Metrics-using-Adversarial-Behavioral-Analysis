Can you help me find a expensive restaurant in the west?
Sure, what type of food are you hoping for?
It's our anniversary and my wife loves british food. I want it to be special, so maybe something expensive.
You have two choices:the Graffiti or the Travellers Rest. Shall I book a table at one of them for you?
Yeah, could you get me a table for 4 on Friday at 13:30 at the Travellers Rest?
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : 183ED5P0 . Is there anything else I can do for you today?
I'm also looking for a museum near the restaurant.
Do you have a preference?
No. Can you recommend one and give me their address?
I recommend going to the Cambridge Book and Print Gallery, in the west. The address is 49 Newnham Road, and there is no entrance fee.
That sounds great! What is the postcode?
The postcode is cb39ey. Will there be anything else today?
Could I also have the phone number to the museum?
Certainly, the phone number is 01223694264. Is there something else I can assist with?
