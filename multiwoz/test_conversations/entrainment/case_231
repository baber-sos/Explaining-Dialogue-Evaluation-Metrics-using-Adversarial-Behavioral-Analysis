I need a hotel for tonight please.
I can help you with that. Do you have a particular price point you are looking for?
It doesn't matter but I do need free parking.
I have several hotels matching your request available. What part of town would you prefer?
I have no preference on the part of town, but I do need free wifi as well.
ok, that narrows it down to 8 options for you. any other preferences?
I would like it to be a guesthouse.
Well there are 21 of those spread across town so I recommend the arbury lodge guesthouse on the North side. Would you like me to book it?
Yes can you please?
What day would you like me to book the hotel for?
I apologize for not mentioning it before, Please book it starting sunday for 1 person for five days?
You're all set for Sunday. Your reference number is NIVMCDK1 . Is there anything else I can help with?
Thanks. Can you give me some information on All Saints Church?
Sure. What sort of information do you require?
I just need the entrance fee and postcode, please.
Admission is free and their post code is CB5 8BS. What else can I help you with today?
I also need a taxi that will leave All Saint's Church by 08:45
And where will the cab need to take you?
i need it to take me back to the hotel room i just reserved
No problem. I've got a taxi booked for you.
I'm not psychic, so I will need to know what kind of car to look for, also the phone number please.
I apologize. The annual psychics convention is next week. They're very particular about being allowed to sense the information. It's a yellow skoda with contact number 07621484267.
