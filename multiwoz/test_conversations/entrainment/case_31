I'm looking for European restaurant in the centre.
I see there are several, can you make a recommendation?
I haven't tried any in that area before. What would you suggest?
I have the eraina that is expensive or the riverside brasserie which is in the moderate range.
Can I get the phone number and postcode for eraina, please?
Their phone number is 01223368786, and postcode is cb23rh.
I also need a cheap place to stay, with free wifi.
I have about 10 different options. To help narrow it down, do you prefer a certain area of town to stay in?
The same area as the restaurant and I prefer a guesthouse.
There are 2 guesthouses that match your specifications. The Alexander Bed and Breakfast has 4 stars, and El Shaddai has 0. Would you like to book one of these?
I would like to book The Alexander Bed and Breakfast
