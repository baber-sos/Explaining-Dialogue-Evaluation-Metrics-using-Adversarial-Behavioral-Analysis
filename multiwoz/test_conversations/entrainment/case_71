There are many trains going to leicester at the time, where are you departing from and on what day?
I am departing from Cambridge on Friday.

Yes, I need 8 tickets. Please send the Ref. No. When you're done.
Your Booking was successful, the total fee is 302.39 GBP payable at the station. Your Reference number is FI1YOZNV . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
