Hi, I'm looking for a guesthouse to stay at that provides free wifi, can you help me find one?
I have several with available booking. May I have an area and a price range that you are interested in?
I am not sure yet but I would like it to have 3 stars.
I'd recommend the Bridge Guest House. It is located in the south area.
That would be great. Can I can the postcode that it is in?
The postcode is cb28rj. Can I help you with anything else?
Yes, I'd like to know about some places to go in town. Are there any college I could visit?
Christ's college is available if that works for you?
Sure, can I get the area it is in and the address please
It's in the centre and the address is saint andrew's street.
