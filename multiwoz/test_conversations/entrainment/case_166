I'm looking for a train to Stevenage that leaves after 17:30. Is there anything available then?
I have a few choices for you. What day are you wanting to travel?
I would like to leave on Thursday out of Cambridge.
The TR0385 leaves at 19:21, would that suit you?
Yes, that sounds perfect. I would like a booking for 4 people.
The booking was successful. Your reference number is SICMOAA9 . Can I help you with anything else?
I am looking for some places to go in town. I want something in the centre that has multiple sports.
I am sorry but there is nothing matching your request. Would you like to try another part of town or type of attraction?
Well, how about any nightclubs?
Yes I have one located on the east side.
Do you have any nightclubs located in the centre?
Yes there are 5 located in the centre. Is there anything I can help you with?
Can I get the phone number for one of them?
