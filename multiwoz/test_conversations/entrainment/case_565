i am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should include free wifi and should include free parking.
Sure, would you like a guesthouse or hotel?
A guesthouse, please. Are there any in the cheap price range?
Oh, yes, there are 9. I do recommend the Autumn House.
Great, could you give me their phone number and address please?
The Autumn House is located at 710 Newmarket Road, CB58RS and the phone number is 01223575122. Can I help with anything else?
Yes, I'm looking for a museum in the west.
How does the cafe jello gallery sound? Or kettles yard?
Could I get the area, phone number, and address of the Kettles yard?
