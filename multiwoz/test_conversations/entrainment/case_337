Hello! Are there any colleges to visit in town?
There are 18. In what area would you like it to be in?
I don't care what area. I do need the postcode, entrance fee and area when you find one.
Christ's College in the centre of town has a free entrance fee and the postcode is cb23bu. What else can I help you with?
