I would like a british food restaurant in the centre.
Sure, there are 7 restaurants that meet your needs. 4 are moderate and 3 are expensive. Do you have a preference?
Only the best for my family .. we'll take the expensive one. Book us a table for 5 at 14:00 on Thursday.
I'm sorry I am having difficulty making a reservation for you. Shall we try another time or restaurant type?
Let's try Italian instead.
Caffe Uno is a very nice, expensive Italian restaurant in the center of town. Would you like a table there?
Actually, I change my mind. I think I want to stick with British food after all. Can you suggest any one thats in the centre of town?
