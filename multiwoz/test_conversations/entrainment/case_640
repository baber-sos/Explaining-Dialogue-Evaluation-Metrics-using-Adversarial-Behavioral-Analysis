I would like some South African food that is not too expensive.
Unfortunately there are no restaurants available that fit that criteria. Is there another type of cuisine you might be interested in eating?
Are there any African restaurants outside of the city center?
The only listing we have is for Bedouin in the city centre. Would you like to try a different type of cuisine?
Yeah, how about a gastropub then?
Yes I have several in the city center. What price range are you ideally looking for?
