I am looking for a museum to go to in Cambridge.
You're in luck! Cambridge has a great number of museums. Did you have an area in mind?
Perhaps the center of town. Can you provide me with information regarding the entrance fee and a telephone number too?
The broughton house gallery is located in the centre is free to enter and the phone number is 01223314960. Can I help you with anything else?
Yes, I need help finding a place to eat. I would like it to be expensive.
Cambridge is full of expensive restaurants? What is your favorite cuisine?
I would prefer a restaurant that serves creative food in the centre of town.
I did not find any expensive restaurants that serve creative food in the centre of town. Would you like a different type of food, area, or price range?
How about an expensive restaurant in the centre that serves turkish food?
I'am sorry there are no restaurants creative food can I find you something else instead?
Yes, can you try to see if there might be one that serves Turkish food in the center of town?
The meze bar restaurant matches your criteria. Would you like me to make a reservation?
Yes please, I need a table for 8 people at 13:45 on Sunday. May I have the reference number for the booking?
