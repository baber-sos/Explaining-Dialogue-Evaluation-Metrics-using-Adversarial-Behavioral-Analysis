I am trying to find a train leaving after 14:45 that's heading out from London Liverpool Street. What do you have?
There are 45 trains that fit your criteria. Please clarify your destination, day of travel and the time you want to arrive by so that i can narrow it down
I need a train to Cambridge on Tuesday.
I have five departures fitting your criteria on the :39 of the hour from 15:39 to 23:39. Would you like me to book any of these for you?
Yes please do book the 15:39
Great, that's train TR5245, leaving london liverpool street going to cambridge at 15:39. I booked 1 ticket for you which is payable at the station.
Thanks! I'm also looking for an expensive restaurant in the center of town.
There are 33 restaurants that match that criteria, what type of food do you wish to eat?
i am looking for something that serves italian cuisine
There are four Italian restaurants, would you like their names?
So long as they're expensive, and in the center of town, I would, thank you.
They are all expensive. There is Stazione, Clowns Cafe, Don Pasquale Pizzeria, and Caffe Uno.
Ok, thank you. One more thing. What was the price of the train ticket?
