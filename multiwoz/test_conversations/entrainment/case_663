I need to find a place to eat in Centre.
There are many restaurants in centre. Did you have a specific price range or cuisine style you prefer?
moderate and British please.
Restaurant one seven looks good and is British in the moderate price range.
Great! Can I book a table for one at 13:45 on Thursday?
Booking was successful they will hold the table for 15 minutes and the reference number is QJMICCEY . Is there anything else I can help with?
Yes. I am also looking for a train departing from cambridge.
Ok what time will you be departing from cambridge? What is your destination?
My destination is kings lynn and I need to arrive by 18:15.
There are quite a few trains that will arrive at the time. What time would you prefer to depart?
What's the last train that gets to Kings Lynn by 18:15 Friday?
That would be train TR9226. It arrives at 17:58.
What time does that train depart?
