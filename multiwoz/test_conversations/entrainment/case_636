Great, can you find a chinese restaurant for me to eat at?
I have 17 chinese restaurants available. Is there a particular area of town or a certain price range you are looking for?
I would like it in the south area of town. If you could recommend one, that would be nice.
There are two expensive restaurants and one cheap one in the south. Would you like me to book one of those for you?
Yes, Sunday, for six at 12:00.
Ok. I have your table reserved at Peking Restaurant, postal code cb28nx. Your reference number is XK8RI3TC
Thanks! I also need to find a try from Cambridge to London Kings Cross on monday.
There are 10 trains available. What time would you like to leave by?
I want to leave after 16:45.
How about TR7786, it departs at 17:00? Or would you like something a little later?
That works. Same group of people. I need the reference number.
I was able to book you for 6 at the restaurant. The total fee is 141.6 GBP and the reference number is 3BNLQ5GL .
