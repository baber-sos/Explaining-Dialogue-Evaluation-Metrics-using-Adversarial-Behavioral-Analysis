Hi. I'm looking for a 4 star hotel in the east.
There are no 4 star hotels in the east side of town. Would you be interested in staying at a guesthouse instead?
Yeah, a guesthouse is what I'm looking for actually.
There are 6 guesthouses in the area. What is your price range?
I don't have a particular price range in mind. What do you suggest for 8 people and 5 nights? I will need it for Wednesday.
I would recommend Autumn House on 710 Newmarket Road. It has Internet and Parking and is cheap. Does that sound good?
Yes and also looking for places to go in town. The attraction should be in the centre and should be in the type of museum
We have many museums to choose from in the centre! Are you looking for an art museum or archaeology or science?
You can choose for me but I would like to know the postcode of the museum.
Castle Galleries is my choice. The postcode is cb23bj. I never made that hotel reservation. Would you like me to do that now?
