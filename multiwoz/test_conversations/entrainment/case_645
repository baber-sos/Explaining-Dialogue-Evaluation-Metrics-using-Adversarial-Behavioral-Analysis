I'm curious about the 3-star lodging options available in Cambridge.
There are no 3-star lodgings available in Cambridge. Shall we check 4-star locations instead?
Sure. Check only for hotels which include free parking also.
There are no 4-star lodgings available in Cambridge that meet your criteria. Shall we check 5-star locations instead?
Yes, please try 5-star hotels with free parking.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything with 5 stars.
try out 1 night then
I do not have 4 or 5 star hotels in that area. Can I try something else?
I want to stay at a 3 star hotel with free parking.
I'm sorry for the confusion. There are two expensive hotels with 3 stars and parking. Do you prefer the centre or the south?
The centre will be fine. Thank you.
All right, sir, that would be the Gonville Hotel on Gonville Place.
Ok, could you book it for 8 people starting Wednesday for 2 nights please.
I'm sorry, Booking was unsuccessful. Would you like to try a shorter stay?
