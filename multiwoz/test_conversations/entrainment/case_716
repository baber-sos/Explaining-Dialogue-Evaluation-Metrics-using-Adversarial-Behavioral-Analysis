I need a hotel for tonight please.
I can help you with that. Do you have a particular price point you are looking for?
It doesn't matter but I do need free parking.
I have several hotels matching your request available. What part of town would you prefer?
I have no preference on the part of town, but I do need free wifi as well.
ok, that narrows it down to 8 options for you. any other preferences?
I would like it to be a guesthouse.
Well there are 21 of those spread across town so I recommend the arbury lodge guesthouse on the North side. Would you like me to book it?
