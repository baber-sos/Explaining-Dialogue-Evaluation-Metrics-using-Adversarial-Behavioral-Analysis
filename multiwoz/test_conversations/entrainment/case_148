Not a problem. What day would you like to travel?

Where will you be traveling from?
I'll be coming from Leicester.
There are 3 trains that arrive before 9:15, one arriving at 6:54, one at 7:54, and one at 8:54. Would you like me to book one of those for you?
How about the 8:54. Can you please book for 7 people and provide me with the reference number?
