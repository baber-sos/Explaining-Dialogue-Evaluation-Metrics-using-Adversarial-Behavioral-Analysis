There are four expensive Chinese restaurants in that part of town. My favorite is Tang Chinese. Would you like to make a reservation?
Tang Chinese sounds good. Please book a table for 7 at 17:30 on Sunday and also provide the reference number. Thanks!
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : 30MRBGVJ . Is there anything else you need?
Thanks! I also need a train for Sunday departing from Peterborough.
