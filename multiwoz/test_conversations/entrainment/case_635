I need a hotel with a zero star rating and I dont need free parking
Cityroomz is a 0 star hotel with no parking, would you like me to check on available dates for you?
i hope its in the centre
It is indeed in the centre.
I need to book it for one person for 5 nights starting Friday.
Booking was not successful. Perhaps another day or shorter stay?
advice me please of a better duration
five nights starting monday would do better
