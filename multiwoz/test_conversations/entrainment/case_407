Hi, I am traveling to Cambridge and could use some help for sure. I am so excited to see some local tourist attractions.
We have 79 attractions to choose from, anything specific that you would like to tell us to help narrow it down?
I'm looking for a hotel called cityroomz.
Cityroomz is a 0-star hotel in the center of town. Its address is Sleeperz Hotel, Station Road.
Can you please book a room for 4 people for 2 nights starting on wednesday?
Booking was successful.Reference number is : WGUYAGN2 anything else i can help?
Thanks. I am also looking for places to go in town. Perhaps an attraction in the city centre.
