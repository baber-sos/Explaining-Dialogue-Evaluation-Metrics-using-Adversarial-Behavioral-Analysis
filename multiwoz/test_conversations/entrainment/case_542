Were you looking for a specific type of food?
Yes, I am looking for a restaurant that offers vegetarian options.
I'm sorry but I do not have any vegetarian restaurants in the Centre area. Would you like me to search another area for you?
Yes, how about expensive turkish food in the centre of town?
You would probably enjoy meze bar restaurant. Would you like me to make a reservation?
