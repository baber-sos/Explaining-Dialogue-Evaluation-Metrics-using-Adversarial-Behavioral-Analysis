We have many trains departing Cambridge, where is your destination?
I would like to go to London Liverpool Street. Could you check the price for me?
The price is 13.28 pounds.
Thanks. I would also love to try a new nightclub to go to. Can you tell me what my options are?
What area would you like the nightclub to be in?
