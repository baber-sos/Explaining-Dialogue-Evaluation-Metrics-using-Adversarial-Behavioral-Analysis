Can you help me find a train that will arrive in birmingham new street by 16:15?
What day would you like to travel?
I would like to leave Friday from Cambridge.
TR2716 will leave cambridge at 13:01 and arrive at birmingham at 15:44. The trip will take 163 minutes and cost 75.10 pounds. Would you like to book?
Yes, I would like to book for 3 people.
I booked the train. It was 225.3 and your reference is AS5SBC8P . Do you need help with anything else?
