Can you help me find a night club in South Cambridge?
The Place is located at 22 Sidney Street. Their phone number is 01223324600. You will need to call for their entry fee.
Can you schedule me a taxi to take me there?
I can book you a taxi, can you tell me the arrival or departure time?
Also, I need a hotel with parking and 2 stars.
I have three options for you - two in the north in the moderate price range and one that's expensive in the east.
OK, tell me about the ones to the north. I need one that's a regular hotel and not a guesthouse.
The ones in the north are the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge. Do you have a preference?
No, please book one of them for me for 4 people staying 2 nights starting Tuesday. Can you provide me with the reference number for that booking?
