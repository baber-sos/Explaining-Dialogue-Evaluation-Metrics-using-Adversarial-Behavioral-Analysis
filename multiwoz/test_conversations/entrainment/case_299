I'm looking for a place to eat in the east that is expensive.
Sure, we have british, chinese, gastropubs, and indian restaurants. Would you like to book a table at one of them.
How about an expensive British place? I'd like a reservation for Wednesday.
okay, I have the Grafton Hotel Restaurant. What time would you like me to book your reservation?
I would like a table at 14:00 on Wednesday for 5 people.
Unfortunately they did not have that day and time available. Would you like to try for another date or time slot?
Do they have an opening at 13:00 on Wednesday for 5 people?
Yes, I've made your reservation. The reference number is 96IH1QYG . What else can I help you with?
That's all, thanks. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Have a great day!
