I want to find a train leaving Cambridge and going to Bishops Stortford. Can you help me?
Yes I can what time are you wanting to leave by?
We need it to leave after 17:00 on Sunday.
I have train TR6742 that leaves at 17:29 and will have you in Bishops Stortford by 18:07. Will that work for you?
Yes could you book one ticket for me and give me the reference number?
Reference number is : BVD5QP16 . Is there anything else?
