I am looking for a theatre in the centre town please.
There are four theaters in Centre
Oh? Which one is the best? How much is their entrance fee?
I do not know the entrance fee for any of the 4 theatres. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Can you give me the name of the theatre you think is best along with the postcode for it?
I really enjoy the Mumford Theatre on East Road. The postcode is cb11pt. Can I get any other information for you?
I really need to know the entrance fee. What would be the best way to figure that out?
