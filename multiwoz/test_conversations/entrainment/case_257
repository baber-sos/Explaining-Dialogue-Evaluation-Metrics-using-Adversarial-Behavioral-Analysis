I am looking for a place in Cambridge. It doesn't need to include internet and should be a hotel.
I was not able to find a hotel type with no internet, but there are hotels with internet.
Okay, that would be fine, as long as it has free parking.
Okay, do you have any preference on price range?
No. How many are available?
There are 8 different hotels around the city with free parking. Do you have a preference for city area or star rating?
It doesn't matter to me which part of the city it's in or it's rating. In your opinion, which one would be best for a short 3 day stay?
It's hard to say. How about the ashley hotel in the norht part of town?
Is there room for 4 people on Monday?
Unfortunately I cannot book that day and time. Would you like to change the day or try a different hotel?
Can i try a different hotel?
How about the Express by Holiday Inn and Cambridge, a 2 star, or Huntingdon Marriott Hotel, a 4 star?
Do either of those include free parking?
Yes, they both have free parking, and internet as well. The Marriott is in the west, and Holiday Inn in the east. Does area of the city matter to you?
No, that does not matter, as long as I can book a 3 night stay for 4 people on Monday.
I was not able to book at either location, can I try something else?
What else is available?
ashley hotel is available, can i provide you more information on it?
We can try and book that one as long as free parking. 4 people for 3 nights.
The only hotel available is university arms hotel. You are booked and the reference number is YJJTTQ9X . It comes with parking and internet and is in the centre.
Thank you. I also need a train from Cambridge on Thursday.
Sure. Where are you headed to and what time would you like to leave Cambridge?
I must arrive by 12:45.
Okay! Where are you going?
I'm going to birmingham new street.
