I am planning a trip in Cambridge,
How can I help you today?
I need to know what museums are in the area. Can you suggest one and let me know what area it is in please?
Is there a location preference?
I don't care what area it is. I was hoping you could make a recommendation.
What about the Byard Art museum in the south part of town?
Sounds great! I also need a train leaving on Thursday from London Kings cross.
