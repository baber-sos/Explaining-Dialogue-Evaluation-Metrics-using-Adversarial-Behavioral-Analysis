I need to find a restaurant in the centre.
Do you prefer a particular type of food or are you looking at a specific price range?
I would like British food. I have no preference of price range.
There are 7 restaurants which meet your needs. The Copper Kettle is located at 4 Kings Parade and serves moderate priced meals. would you like to make reservations?
