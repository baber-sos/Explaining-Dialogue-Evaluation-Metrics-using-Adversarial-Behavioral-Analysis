I'm looking for a place to stay in Cambridge.
We have 33 locations to stay, do you have any other requirements?
I'd like a moderately priced hotel in the south, with free wifi.
bridge guest house is your choice. its located in 151 hills road. can i give you the address
You just gave me the address. Does it have free parking?
Yes, both free internet and free parking. Can I help you with anything else today?
I'm looking for a chinese restaurant as well. Is there anything near the hotel?
There are 3 chinese restaurants in the South. Two are in the expensive range and one cheap. Do you have a preference?
I really need that to be in the south.
Yes, I have the lucky star if you would like a cheap option, or there are two more expensive options. Do you have a preference?
The lucky star would be just fine. I need the postcode please.
The postcode is cb17dy. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Thanks. Yes, I will need a taxi from the hotel to the lucky star restaurant.
