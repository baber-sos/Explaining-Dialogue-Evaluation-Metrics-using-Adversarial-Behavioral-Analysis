I am looking for a hotel.
There are a total of 9 hotels. Huntingdon Marriotte Hotel is a good choice with a 4 star rating. Would you like there phone number?
I actually need a place that has free wifi and is in the south part of town. And it needs to be a hotel, not a guesthouse.
The lensfield hotel is the only hotel that matches your criteria. Would you like to book a stay?
I'd just need their star rating and phone number, thank you.
