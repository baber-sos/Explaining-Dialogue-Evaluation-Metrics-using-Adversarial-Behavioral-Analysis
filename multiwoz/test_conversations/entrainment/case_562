Hi there! I'm looking for an expensive place to stay that has free wifi. I bet Cambridge has a ton of those.
We have 5 hotels that fit that description. What area of town do you prefer?
The area doesn't matter much, but I would like it to be a guesthouse if possible.
I'm sorry, but all of the places that have free wifi and who have an expensive price range are hotels rather than guesthouses. Would you be interested in a hotel instead?
I'd really rather stay at a guesthouse. Do you have anything in the cheap price range?
There are 9 locations that meet your requirements. Is there a particular star rating you'd prefer?
No not in particular.
I could recommend the el shaddai. It has free internet and parking and is in the centre. Would you like me to book that for you?
What is the phone number of the el shaddai?
Their phone number is 01223327978, would you like help booking a room?
