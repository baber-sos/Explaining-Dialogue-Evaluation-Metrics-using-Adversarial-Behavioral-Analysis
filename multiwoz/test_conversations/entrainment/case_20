Great I also am looking to find an attraction in the centre of town.
There are 44 attractions in City Centre. Is there a particular type you want to visit?
Do you have any swimming pools?
Yes, its called parkside pools, located at gonville place.
How much does it cost to get in?
I'm sorry, our system seems to be missing that information. Is there anything else you need help with today?
What is the phone number for Parkside Pools? I'll just call them to get the entrance fee myself.
The phone number is 01223446100. is there anything else I can help you with?
What is the entrance fee to the Parkside Pool?
I'm afraid I don't have the information about the entrance fee to Parkside pool, sorry about that. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Are there any attractions in the centre that do list the entrance fee along with the phone number? It doesn't have to be a swimming pool.
