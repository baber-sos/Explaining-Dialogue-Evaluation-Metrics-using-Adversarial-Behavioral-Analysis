I need to find a hotel that has free parking.
Sure I can help with that. What area will you be staying in?
In the centre, I more specifically am looking for a guesthouse with a 0 star rating in that area.
El Shaddai is a 0 star guesthouse located in the centre has both free parking and wifi. What days are you interested in staying there? can I book for you?
Yes please. book it for 5 people and 3 nights starting from tuesday
Okay, will you be needing a reference number?
Yes, please for my records
I have your reservation for 5 people, 3 nights starting on tuesday. your reference number is X3MDWDWY, can I help with anything else?
Yes, I am interested in places to go while I am in town. Perhaps a museum in the same area as the hotel.
