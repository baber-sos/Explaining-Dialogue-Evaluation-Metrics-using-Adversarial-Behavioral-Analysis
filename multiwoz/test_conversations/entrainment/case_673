Hi, I need to get in from King's Lynn to Cambridge
There are 133 trains making that trip, do you have a day and time you want to travel?
I'm looking to leave Friday after 21:15, if you could book me a reservation for that time period that would be great.
TR0672 departs at 22:11. Can you tell me how many tickets you need?
I need 2 please.
Booking was successful, the total fee is 19.6 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : 4J73XCBG . Is there anything else I can help with?
No thank you. That is all I need.
