I'm trying to find a 4-star hotel that's moderately priced please
Do you have a certain area you would like ?
No. but it should also have free wifi.
I was not able to find any hotels matching that requirement, is there something else you would like to try?
You don't have any moderately priced 4 stars with wifi?
We do have guesthouses available. Is that okay?
Yes if you can find a place for 5 people
I can help! for how many days starting when?
2 nights, starting on Wednesday please
The acorn guest house Booking was successful. Reference number is : MZ8CPFEK
Great! Thank you. I need to find a restaurant called rice boat.
What would you like to know about it?
What type of food do they serve?
They serve Indian food. Do you need any other information, or help making a booking?
