Are there any British restaurants in the centre?
Oh yes I have quite a few. Did you have a preferred price range in mind?
I'd like an expensive restaurant please.
I found three restaurants: Fitzbillies Restaurant, The Cambridge Chop House, or Midsummer House Restaurant. Would you like a table booked?
