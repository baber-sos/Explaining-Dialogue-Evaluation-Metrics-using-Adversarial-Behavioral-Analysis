I'm sorry, there seems to be an error. Can you please restate your request?
i actually need a train
What are your departure and destination locations?
Departing from Cambridge and going to Leicester on Tuesday.
TR6985 leaves at 09:21 and cost is 37.80. can we book?
Yes, please, for 3 people.
Your reservation on train ID TR6985 for a party of 3 was successful. Your Reference number is : DQP9UAPU .
Thanks, can you also lookup a hotel for me? I think it's called the lovell lodge.
They are a hotel that is moderately priced in the north. It is 2 star rated and offers free parking and wifi. Did you need a room?
I would like to book a room for 3 people for 5 nights starting Thursday if possible, if not Sunday. Can I also have the reference number?
You are all booked for Thursday. Your reference number is ETI1VJ3V . Is there anything else I can help you with?
