Hello! Are there any colleges to visit in town?
There are 18. In what area would you like it to be in?
I don't care what area. I do need the postcode, entrance fee and area when you find one.
Christ's College in the centre of town has a free entrance fee and the postcode is cb23bu. What else can I help you with?
Im also looking for a cheap hotel with free parking.
That leaves us with about 10 options. Do you have a preferred area or price range?
As I said before, I'd like something cheap. Centre area is preferred.
