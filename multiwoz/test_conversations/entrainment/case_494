I need a train to take me from Cambridge to Broxbourne.
Sure. What time would you like to depart?
I don't know. I want to get there at 08:15 though.
Also, what day will you be travelling?
I will be travelling on Monday.
Alright, the latest train that fits your criteria is TR3174, which will arrive at 8:01. Is that alright by you?
Yes that will be fine thank you. Can you tell me how long the journey will be and how much it will cost and when the train leaves?
Yes travel time is 60 minutes and the cost of the ticket is 17.90 pounds.
What is the exact departure time please?
The train leaves Cambridge at 07:01. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Can you book me a seat on the train please?
I'd be happy to. Just one ticket or how many would you like?
Actually, I am not ready to book quite yet. Thank you for all of your help. Have a nice day. Bye.
You have a nice day also. Good bye.
