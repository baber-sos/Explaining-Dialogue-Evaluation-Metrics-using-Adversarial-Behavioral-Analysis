Where is a 4 star hotel located in North Cambridge?
I have several options, almost all of which are moderate guesthouses. I do have one cheap one, too. Would you like to book a room?
Sure , that could be nice
OK, how many are in your party, what day will you arrive, and how many nights will you be staying?
I actually don't need reservations I just need the phone number, price range.
As I mentioned it is cherap and the phone number is 01223316074.
Okay. now could you help me find a restaurant in the expensive price range that is in the same area as the hotel?
