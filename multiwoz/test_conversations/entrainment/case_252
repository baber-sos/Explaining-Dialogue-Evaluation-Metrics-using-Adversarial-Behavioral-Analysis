I am looking for a place to eat that's expensive and serves afternoon tea. Can you help me?
I'm sorry, there are no restaurants like that in Cambridge unfortunately.
How about an expensive indian restaurant?
I have 14 matches, do you have a location preference?
No particular part of town, I'd appreciate a reccomendation. Can you make reservations for me?
I would recommend pipasha restaurant on the east side of town. How many people are in your group and when do you need the reservation for?
I would like a reservation for Sunday for 5 people at 17:00.
