I am looking for a restaurant called loch fyne
That is a nice seafood restaurant located on Trumpington Street. Can I reserve a table for you?
Can you tell me a little more about the place? I need to know what type of food they serve, price range and where it's located.
It is an expensive restaurant. They serve seafood and they are located at The Little Rose 37 Trumpington Street.
Great. I also need to know about a hotel called the Hamilton lodge.
Hamilton lodge is a guesthouse located in the north part of town is moderately priced and has a 3 star rating. Would you like me to book it?
Yes please. I need 2 night stay starting from Friday for 3 people.
Unsuccessful book. Would like to add or delete a day?
I really want to stay there so can I get it for one night?
