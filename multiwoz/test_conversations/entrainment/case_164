My friends said that I must visit Corpus Christi, can you please give me some more information about it?
I certainly can. Corpus Christi is a college located in the center of town, on King's Parade. There's a two pound entrance fee. Do you need any additional information?
Yes. What is the postcode?
The postcode is cb21rh. Do you need anything else?
Are there any African restaurants in the centre?
I have one listing for bedouin would that work for you?
Is this listing in the expensive price range?
Yes, it is in the expensive price range, shall I book you a table?
