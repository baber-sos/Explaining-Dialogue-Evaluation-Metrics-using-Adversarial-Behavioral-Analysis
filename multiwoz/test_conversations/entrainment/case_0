Can you find me a three star place to stay?
Sure, what area are you thinking of staying?
I don't have an area preference but it needs to have free wifi and parking at a moderate price.
I'll recommend Hamilton Lodge. Their phone number is 01223365664
Okay sounds great, can you book a room for me?
Sure I can. How many people in your party and for how many nights?
Actually, I don't need a room right now, but I do need a train. I'll be heading out to King's Lynn on Sunday.
fantastic, do you know your travel times?
I was hoping to leave from Cambridge some time after 10:00.
There is a train that leaves at 10:11. Would you be interested in more information or would you like to book it now?
Can you book tickets for 4 people please?
Your booking was successful. Your reference number is 5RLFJOGZ in case you need it. Is there anything else I can help you with?
