I need a train that leaves on Monday going to Cambridge.
Wonderful, I can help you. Could you tell me where you're departing from so we can begin to book your ticket?
Yes, I'll be departing from London Kings Cross. I'd also like to arrive in Cambridge by 10:30.
Train TR0378 would leave at 05:17 and arrive at at 06:08. Would you like me to book that for you?
