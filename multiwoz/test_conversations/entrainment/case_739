I am excited to be coming to visit and hoping to see a college while in town.
There are more than 70 to choose from! Which area of town are you most interested in?
I'd like it to be in the center of town. What's the address of your favorite one?
Downing College is my favorite. It's located on regent street and it's free to get in.
That sounds Like a great suggestion, what is the easiest way to get there?
Downing College is located at Regent Street in the center of town.
I'm also looking for a guesthouse in town.
There are quite a few options to choose from. Do you have a preference regarding price range or which area the guesthouse is located in?
I'd prefer a four star hotel, it doesn't matter where in the city as I'll have a car. I'd also prefer that they offer free parking and wifi.
Did you have a particular price range in mind?
No, I do not.
I have a 16 matches, I need more information on area and price, please
I would prefer a guesthouse. Does that help narrow it down?
All 16 are guesthouses. If I may, might I suggest the Worth House. It is in the north and 4 star rated. They offer both free parking and wifi.
