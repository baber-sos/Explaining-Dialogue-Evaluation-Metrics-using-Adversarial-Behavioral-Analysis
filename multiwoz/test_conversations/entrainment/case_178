Hello, I am looking to stay in a guesthouse that includes free parking
I have lots of them to choose from. Is there any area of town that I can check into for you?
No. I would like it to have a star rating of 4 and free wifi.
There are 16 such guest houses. You might like the Alexander B and B, which is rated 4 stars, yet inexpensive, and offers all the luxury the others choices do.
That sounds great! Can you book the Alexander for 2 people? We'll need it for 5 nights starting on Thursday.
I am afraid that was unsuccessful. Would like to book another day or a shorter stay?
Can we try 2 nights instead then? I'll need the reference number as well.
Your booking at the Alexander for 2 nights was successful. Your reference number is X7VU6Y8Y . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
