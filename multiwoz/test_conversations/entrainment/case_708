I am looking for an expensive hotel with free parking.
We have 5 places that offer all of that. Any preference on star rating or area?
No, that's not important to me. But, I would prefer to stay in a guesthouse with free parking.
Sorry, there are no guesthouse type expensive places with free parking. Perhaps you'd prefer a different type or price range?
Cheap would be fine as well.
Sure, the Allenbell is a 4 star guesthouse. Does that sound good?
Yes. Can you make a reservation for 4 nights starting Wednesday? There are 5 people in my party.
I've made your reservation. The reference number is E8NPWA4B . What else can I help you with?
