I would like a guesthouse with free wifi please.
We have 23 different options available. Is there an area you would prefer?
I'm looking for something expensive in the north.
There are no expensive guesthouses in the north with free wifi.
OK, how about a moderately priced one?
There are 8 moderately priced guesthouses in the north. May I suggest the 4 star Acorn Guest house?
Are there any expensive hotels in the north? I plan on staying with 4 other people for 4 nights, starting wednesday.
Do you have a parking preference?
No parking preference. Can you please recommend one.
