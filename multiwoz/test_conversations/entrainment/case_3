What price range are you looking at?
I would like a expensive price range.
How about caffee uno. there are also 3 others.
That sounds interesting actually. Can you give me the address and phone number perhaps?
Sure, they are on 32 Bridge Street City Centre and their number is 01223448620.
Great can I also get some information on the huntingdon marriott hotel?
Huntingdon Marriott Hotel has 4 stars and is located in the west and is in the expensive price range. They have internet and parking.
Thanks for the information. Have a lovely day.
Can I help you with anything else today?
Yes, actually. What is the postcode of Caffee Uno?
The postcode for Caffe Uno is cb21uj. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Can I get a taxi to take me from the restaurant to the hotel?
What time would you like that taxi to pick you up?
I am wanting to leave the restaurant by 11:45. Once the taxi is booked, can I have the contact number and car type?
