I would like to find a train leaving on Thursday.
I'd be happy to help you with that. Where are you departure and arrival locations?
I will be leaving from Kings Lynn, traveling to Cambridge.
We have nineteen trains available that day. What time would you like to leave by?
Anytime after 13:30 would be great.
Okay the TR2162 leaves at 14:11.
What's the arrival time for that train?
That train arrives at 14:58. Will that work for you?
As long as it leaves after 13:30, yes.
It leaves at 14:11. Would you like to book it?
Not right now. I'm also looking for an entertainment attraction on the east side of town. I'll need their phone number and postcode.
Okay we have two. The Cherry Hinton Hall and Grounds and Funky Fun House.
Can you send me the phone number and postcode for the Funky Fun House?
