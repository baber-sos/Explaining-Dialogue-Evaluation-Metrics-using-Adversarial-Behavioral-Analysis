Could you help me find a boat to visit on the north side?
I have one in that area. It's called the Riverboat Georgina. It's located at Cambridge Passenger Cruisers, Jubilee House. Would you like their phone number for more information?
Yes, I want the phone number and also the entrance fee, please.
