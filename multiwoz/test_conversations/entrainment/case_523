Can you see if there are any entertainment attractions in the centre of town?
Unfortunately there are no entertainment attractions in the centre of town. Is there a different area of town that would work for you?
What about a museum?
Yes, there are 11 museums. I'd recommend Broughton House Gallery. It's at 98 King Street cb11ln and has free entrance. Would that work for you?
Yes, that will work great. Can I get their phone number please?
Certainly. The Broughton House Gallery's phone number is 01223314960. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
