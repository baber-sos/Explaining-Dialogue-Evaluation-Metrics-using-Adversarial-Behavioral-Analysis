I'm planning a trip to Cambridge and I would like some information on great saint mary's church. Where exactly is it located?
It is located in the centre. The address is market square. Postcode is cb23pq. The entrance fee is 2 pounds.
Thank you. That's all I I need.
Is there anything else I can help you with.
Can I please get their phone number as well? I also need help finding a train for Monday.
Yes of course. Their telephone number is 01223350914.
I also need a train from birmingham new street on monday that goes to cambrige by 20:30.
For how many people?
I'm not sure yet. For now can I just get the train ID, travel time and departure time?
Train ID TR3130 sounds like your best bet. It leaves at 17:40 and arrives in Cambridge at 20:23. Travel time is 163 minutes.
Thanks so much!
No problem at all! Is there anything more I can help you with today?
