I am going to Cambridge and need a place to eat that serves lebanese food and is cheaply priced.
Unfortunately there are no Lebanese restaurants in the cheap price range. Would you like another cuisine type or price range?
What kind of cheap restaurants are there in the center of town?
I'm sorry, there are none. Would you like to change your cuisine type or location?
how about one that serves indian food?
I found three cheap indian restaurants in the centre. Would you like to book at Mahal of Cambridge?
That sounds great. I need a table for 6 at 16:30 on Saturday, please. And I will need the reference number once it's booked.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Your reference number is ZCRT70X4 . Can I help with anything else?
I need to book a train on Sunday as well.
There are 404 entries for Sunday. Where would you like to depart from?
I'm departing from cambridge.
And what would your preferred destination be?
The train should arrive in broxbourne by 08:45.
I have found three trains leaving Cambridge for Broxbourne. They arrive at 06:01, 07:01, and 08:01. Each departs one hour from their arrival time. Which train would you like to book?
I suppose I will book the train arriving at 7:01. Please provide me with the reference number.
Sure, I can book that for you. How many tickets would you like?
