I'd like a moderately priced hotel with free parking, please.

Is that located in the north. I really want to stay somewhere in the north.
Yes that is located in the north. Should I book it for you?
Does it also have internet access?
It does have wifi.
Does it include free parking?
Yes it does. Would you like me to book you a room?
I have to discuss it with my husband, so no thanks. Can you tell me about trains leaving Monday? I need to arrive by 10:45.
And where do you want to travel to and from?
I will be traveling from Cambridge heading to Bishops Stortford.
I have 3 trains that would suit your needs. May I suggest the one that arrives by 10:07?
Yes that works for me. Can I have the travel time and the train ID?
