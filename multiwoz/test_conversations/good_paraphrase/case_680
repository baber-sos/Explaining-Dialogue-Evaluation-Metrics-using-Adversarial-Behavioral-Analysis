Great, can you find a chinese restaurant for me to eat at?
I have 17 chinese restaurants available. Is there a particular area of town or a certain price range you are looking for?
I would like it in the south area of town. If you could recommend one, that would be nice.
There are two expensive restaurants and one cheap one in the south. Would you like me to book one of those for you?
Yes, Sunday, for six at 12:00.
