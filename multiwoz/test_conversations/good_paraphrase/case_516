I'm looking for an expensive restaurant in the north area
I have moderate and expensive priced restaurants. City stop restaurant serves european and is on the expensive side. Or may I suggest saigon city, they have asian?
Do any of them specialize in chinese?
Yes, both Hakka and The Hotpot serve Chinese. Can I book either for you?
Lets try Hakka. It will be just myself at 16:45 on tuesday.
