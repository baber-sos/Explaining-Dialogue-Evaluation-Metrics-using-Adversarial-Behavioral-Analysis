Yes I am looking for information on a restaurant called Bangkok City.
That is an expensive Thai restaurant. Do you want me to book a reservation?
Yes, 5 people, friday at 14:15.
Sorry, there are no tables available for your party then. Perhaps another day or time?
Oh no. Can you get us in at 13:15 then?
Yes, that time is available, and I've reserved your table. The reference number is WI602I6M .
Thanks! That's all I needed today - goodbye!
