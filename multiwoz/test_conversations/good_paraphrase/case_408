Are there any expensive British restaurants?
Of course! We have a variety of them in the east, west, and centre. What area would you prefer?
I'd like for it to be in the West please.
I have two, Graffiti and Travelers Rest, shall I go ahead and try to book?
I am not quite ready to book a table, however I would like the phone number and address of each restaurant including the postcode.
Graffiti is located at Hotel Felix Whitehouse Lane Huntingdon Road, 01223277977, cb30lx. Travellers Rest is located at Huntingdon Road City Centre, 01223276182, cb30df. Can I help you more?
I'm looking for a train that leaves on Sunday and arrive by 12:00.
Where will you be departing and arriving from?
I will be departing from Cambridge and traveling to Stevenage.
I have train TR5390 leaving cambridge at 5:21 and arriving at 6:10 on sunday. Would you like to book this?
Yes please! I think that is all I need, thank you.
Okay, if you'd like a booking, I'll need to know how many tickets you need. Or, if we're done here, have a very nice day.
Yes, that is all. Thanks again.
You're welcome. If you need any help in the future I'll be here.
