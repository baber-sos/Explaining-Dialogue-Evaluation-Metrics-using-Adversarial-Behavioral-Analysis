Hi, I'm looking for a restaurant with modern european food. It should be in the moderate price range.
What area are you wanting to be in?
Doesn't really matter. Is there one in the centre?
Yes, there are 2: De Luca Cucina and Bar & Riverside Brasserie. Would you like further information?
Can I book De Luca Cucina and Bar for 6 people at 19:15 on saturday please?
