Yeah, I'm visiting Cambridge and was wondering if you could tell me about the All Saints Church?
Good choice! all saints church has beautiful architecture, located on jesus lane in the town center. Phone number is 01223452587.
Can you tell me what part of town the church is located in?
All Saint's in in the centre of town. Is there anything else you would like to know?
Great, I am also looking to stay at a guesthouse in the north
I found 11 guesthouses in the north. Did you have a star rating that you wanted?
No particular star rating but I do want free wifi.
Many of the guesthouses in the North offer internet, will you require parking?
Parking is not important. Could you recommend one for me?
I am showing 10 available guesthouses in the north. Could you narrow it down by pricerange or stars?
I'm looking for a room less then 130 a night with at least a 4 star rating.
