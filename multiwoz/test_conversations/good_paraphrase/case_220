Hi. I'd like to find a very nice restaurant to go to.
Sure, are you looking for anything specific?
I am looking for something expensive and in the southern part of town.
Can I ask what type of food you are looking for?
It doesn't really matter. What can you recommend?
I have five places. The Peking is a nice place. Shall I book it?
Please, I'll need a table for 4 at 12:30 on Sunday.
You are booked for sunday and your reference number is KLH0CDT4 . May I help you with anything else today?
Yes, I am looking for a museum. Can you recommend any?
There are many in our lovely city. The broughton house gallery, the cafe jello gallery and cambridge artworks.
The cafe jello gallery sounds interesting. What is their phone number?
01223312112 and free admission!
Great that's all I needed today, thank you!
Thank you for using the Cambridge TownInfo centre. Have a great day.
