I would like to find a train leaving on Thursday.
I'd be happy to help you with that. Where are you departure and arrival locations?
I will be leaving from Kings Lynn, traveling to Cambridge.
We have nineteen trains available that day. What time would you like to leave by?
Anytime after 13:30 would be great.
