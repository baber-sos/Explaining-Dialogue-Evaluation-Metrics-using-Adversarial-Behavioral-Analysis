Hi. I was wondering if there are any Eastern European type restaurants in the south part of the city?
Unfortunately, there are no eastern European restuarants in the south part of the city. Is there anything else you want?
I'm looking for an expensive eastern european place in the south.
Unfortunately, I don't happen to have any listing that meets what you were looking for. Would you like me to try either a different area or type of restaurant?
