I need to take a train from cambridge, I need to arrive by 18:30.
We have quite a few trains that may suit your needs. Do you have a particular day you are traveling?
Yes, I need to leave Broxbourne on Tuesday.
Okay, I have one arriving at 6:01, would you like me to book it?
What is the train id, please?
The train ID is TR6357. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
Can you find me a park in the south?
There are two parks that meet your description: Sheep's Green and Lammas Land Park Fen Causeway and Wandlebury Country Park. Would you like more information on either of those?
