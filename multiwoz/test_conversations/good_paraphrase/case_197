Hi, I'll be coming in to Cambridge and I'd like a place to stay. I'd like a guesthouse with free parking.
I've got 33 guesthouses that offer free parking, do you have any more preferences?
I'd like it to be in the east, if possible.
There are five guesthouses that offer free parking. 3 are cheap and 2 are moderate. Which pricerange do you prefer?
I'll take a cheap one please.
