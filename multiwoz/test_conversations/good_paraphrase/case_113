Do you have a monday train that I can take to cambridge? I want to try some local restaurants.
We have thousands of options, I will need to narrow this down. Where will you be coming from and do you have a date and time preference?
Yes, I would like to arrive by 12:15 on monday. Thanks.
Their is a departure at london kings cross on monday at 7:17am.
Book that for me please. I need it for 5 people.
It's booked and will cost 118 GBP which is payable at the station. Your reference number is SUKSS2J6 .
Thank you. I'm also looking for more information on a restaurant called golden house. Is there anything you can tell me about it?
Golden House is an inexpensive Chinese restaurant located in the centre of town. Do you need more information?
Yes, may I have their phone number? And the price range?
Sure, their number is 01842753771 and they are located 12 Lensfield Road City Centre and they are cheap.
That's all I need.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
No, that's all. Goodbye!
Have a good day! Glad I could help.
