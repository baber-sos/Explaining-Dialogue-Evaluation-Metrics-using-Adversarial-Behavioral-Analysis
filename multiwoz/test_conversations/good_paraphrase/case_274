I am looking for a cheap place to dine that serves belgian food.
I'm sorry, but there are no belgian restaurants in all of cambridge. Would you like a different type of cuisine?
Let's try Indian food, but it needs to be near the centre of town.
There are no Belgian restaurants in the center of the town. Would you like to try another type of restaurant?
Is there a cheap Italian place in the centre instead?
Yes, I've got pizza hut city centre in that area. Would you like to try it?
I want to book a table for 1 person at 16:30 on saturday.
