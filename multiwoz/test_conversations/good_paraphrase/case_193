I am looking for someplace to go that is a park
There are five different parks in the area, one each in the north, centre and east, and two in the south. Do you have a specific location you'd like?
Could you give me the postcode and entrance fee for the park in the north?
Sure! That would be milton country park. The postcode is cb46az and admission is free. Can I help you with anything else today?
i am also looking for a train that leaves after 21.45 to cambridge
Could you please tell me where you will be departing from and what day you are traveling?
I am leaving from Leicester and I want to travel on Saturday.
There are two trains available. One leaves at 22:09 and the other at 23:09. Which train do you prefer?
Either one will work, once you have chosen one please tell me the arrival time.
Tr4509 departs at 23:09 and arrives at 24:54. Would you like me to book you a seat?
