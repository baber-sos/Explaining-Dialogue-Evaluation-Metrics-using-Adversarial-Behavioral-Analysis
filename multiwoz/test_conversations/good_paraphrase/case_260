I need a train from london liverpool street.
May I ask where you are travelling to? And what day?
Cambridge, on Wednesday.
Is there a certain time you would like to arrive in cambridge?
No. I just need to leave after 14:00.
I have train TR7978 leaving at 15:39 and arriving at 17:07. Would you like to book that?
Not right now, thank you. I'm also looking for a place to dine. I would like an expensive restaurant in the centre of town.
I have 33 restaurants available. Do you have a type of food preference?
Do you have anything that serves modern european food?
there is one in that area called darrys cookhouse and wine shop
Okay that sounds good. How about reserving a table for me for 18:15 for one person on Wednesday.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : GZ0X842D . Anything else I can help with?
No thank you that will be all
Thank you for using the Cambridge TownInfo centre. Please have a pleasant day.
