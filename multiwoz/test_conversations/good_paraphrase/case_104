I kind of need some help finding a nice hotel in the north part of town.
There are two hotels in the north part of town in the moderate price range, does that price range work for you?
Do either of those have 4 stars?
I'm sorry, they are both 2 star hotels. Would you like to try a different area or star number?
A 4 star guesthouse in the north would be fine too.
There are several in the moderate price range and one that is cheap. Does price matter?
No, it doesn't. What place would you recommend?
