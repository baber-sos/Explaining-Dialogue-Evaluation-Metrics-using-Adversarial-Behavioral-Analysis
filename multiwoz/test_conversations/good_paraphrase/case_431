I'm looking for a place to stay during my upcoming trip to Cambridge.
I can definitely help you with that! What area are you staying in, and what's your price range?
it should be located in the west and should be cheap.
I have two options for you, and they are both 4 stars: Finches Bed and Breakfast is a guesthouse and The Cambridge Belfry is a hotel.
Actually, I'm sorry. I said I wanted something cheap, but I'm actually thinking I want something expensive instead.
Oh, no problem. You would love the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel. 4 stars, expensive, free everything.
Can you book it please?
For how many people. What night and how long?
Book a 4 night stay starting Saturday for 5 people
Okay, the booking was successful. The reference number is TKFWTSZE . Can I help you with anything else?
Yes. I am also looking for a concert hall to visit in the east.
There are none would you like to try a different area?
How about an entertainment place in the east?
I found 2 entertainment places. Cherry Hinton Hall and Grounds and Funky Fun House both located in the east. Do you have a preference?
