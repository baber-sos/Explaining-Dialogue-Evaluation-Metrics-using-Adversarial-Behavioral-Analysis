i am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should include free wifi and should include free parking.
What about acorn house? It seems lovely
I need something cheap and in the centre of town.
In that case, you have two selections. The Alexander Bed and Breakfast is one. The other is El Shaddai. Were you looking for a particular star rating?
Could you book me a room at The Alexander Bed and Breakfast for 6 people and 2 nights starting from friday?
Yes, I just did. Would you like their phone number?
Can you please give me the confirmation number for my booking?
Your reservation has been made for Alexander Bed and Breakfast for 2 days starting Friday for 6 people Your reference number is 9ZK2B30Y . Is there anything else I can do?
I need the phone number for a museum as well. Any one will do.
broughton house gallery is also located in the centre of town. Their phone number is 01223314960. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
Hmmm I'm not sure. I think that might be everything but let me think for a second.
Did you come up with anything?
i need to book a taxi to commute between the two places.
I have booked you a taxi leaving at 13:00. It will be a blue volvo and the contact number is 07695646111.
