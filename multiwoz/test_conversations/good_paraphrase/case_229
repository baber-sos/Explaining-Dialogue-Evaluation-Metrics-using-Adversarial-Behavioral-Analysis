Can you give me directions to Byard Art in Cambridge?
I can tell you that Byard Art is located at 14 King's Parade, postcode cb21sj. Does that help?
Yes, I will also need the phone number and entrance fee please.
The number is 01223464646 and it is free of charge.
Can you give me the address please?
The address is 14 king's parade. Do you need anything else?
Hmm, that number doesn't seem like it would be correct. Can you double check that for me?
Yes, I am so sorry for the error. The correct phone number is 01223464646 and admission is actually free.
Can you help me find a 4 star hotel, and it doesn't matter if it doesn't have internet.
There are 21 options. Do you have any other preferences to narrow the search?
I would like it to be in the moderate price range and include free parking.
I have moderate hotels across Cambridge do you have an area in mind?
No, but I do need free wifi. Could you book a room for Wednesday? I will need it for 4 nights. I will be alone.
Booking was unsuccessful. Would you like to shorten your stay or add another day?
How about 1 night? Could you also please provide me with the reference number? I would also like to book a taxi.
Booking was successful at acorn guest house. Reference number is M8SHUQUG .
