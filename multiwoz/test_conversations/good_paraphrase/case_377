Hello! I need a train departing Cambridge after 18:30, please.
What day would you like to travel?
I would like to leave on Friday and go to Birmingham New Street.
I have 5 trains departing cambridge on Friday to birmingham new street. The earliest is leaving at 19:01 arriving by 21:44, will this suit you?
Yes. I'd like 3 tickets on the 19:01 train, please. And can I have the reference number?
Booking was successful for TR5389, the total fee is 225.3 GBP payable at the station. Your reference number is E9OPMWVM . Do you need further assistance?
Yes. I would like to know about places to go in the west area of town.
Well, there are quite a few museums and colleges you can visit in this area. Do you want to pay an entrance fee?
I would like to go to a concerthall.
I'm sorry but I don't have any concert halls in the West part of town.
I suppose a museum would do as well. Any recommendations for museums west of town?
Absolutely! We have 7 of them. Would you like details on any specific one?
Any of them would be fine. Can you just give me the name, address with postcode and the phone number? Thanks.
Sure thing! I've picked for you Kettle's Yard Museum. Their phone is 01223295264 and they're located in postcode cb30aq at 23 high street, fen ditton. Is that everything you need today?
No, that's all I need. Thank you.
