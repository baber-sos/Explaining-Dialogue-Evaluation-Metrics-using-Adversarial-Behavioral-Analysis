Hi, I'm looking for a train that will be leaving after 19:30 that goes to Kings Lynn.
Where are you departing from?
I'll be leaving from Cambridge on Friday.
I have four available trains that day? Is there a certain time that you would like to arrive by to your destination?
I need to arrive by 18:00 and I am going to ely.
The closest I have to your arrival time is 16:07. Would you like to book it?
Yes, please, can you book me for 2 people, and I need th ereference number.
You are all set! Your train's reference number is: KGRZSK8S . A total of 8.8 GBP is payable at the station. Can I help you further?
Yes i am looking to go to a sporting events up north. Do you have any suggestions?
I don't have anything meeting that criteria. Can I try something else?
Okay then can we search for a park in the north instead then?
