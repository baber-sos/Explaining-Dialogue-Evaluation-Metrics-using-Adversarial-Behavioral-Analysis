I'm looking for an expensive hotel with free wifi.
I have about 5 different ones all spread out over town. Do you have a certain preference on the area to stay in?
Not really on the area. But I would like an expensive guesthouse.
I'm afraid we don't have any guesthouses in that price range, can I offer you something else instead?
