I am looking for suggestions for a cheaper restaurant in the center of town.
I have several listings available for you to choose from, is there any preference on the type of food they serve for you?
Not really. Just get me a table for 3 on Tuesday at 17:00
Would you like me to book you a table at Dojo Noodle Bar at 40210 Millers Yard City Centre for Tuesday at 17:00 for 3 people?
Yes please, if that time doesn't work, we can try for 16:00.
Your booking for 3 at the Dojo Noodle Bar for Tuesday at 16:00. Your reference number is V65S4LW2 .
I also need a hotel with free parking and free wifi.
