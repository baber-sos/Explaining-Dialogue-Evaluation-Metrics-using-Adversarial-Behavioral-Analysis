I need to book a train ticket going to Cambridge any day but has to arrive by 18:30, can you assist me with that?
I will be glad to help you with that. Where will you be departing from?
I will be leaving london kings cross on sunday.
Awesome. Will it be just you that wants to book this?
Actually, I decided not to book it just now. However, what's the travel time for that route?
All of the available trains for that day from London Kings Cross to Cambridge have a travel time of 51 minutes.
Thank you. Can you assist me with finding a hotel as well?
Certainly. What sort of hotel did you have in mind?
I'd like a hotel in the moderate price range with free wifi.
I have 17 hotels that fit those criteria, is there a particular area or type of accommodation you would prefer?
What have you got with 0 stars?
Yes I have one called Cityroomz. Would you like me to book it for you?
Yes, for one person. I'd like it for 4 nights starting sunday. Please provide a reference number.
The booking was successful. Your reference number is KT14CB0J . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Thank you! I think that's everything. You've been a big help.
