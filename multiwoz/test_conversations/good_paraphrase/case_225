I'm just looking for Great Saint Mary's Church.
That's a great choice! It is an architecture attraction in the centre of town at market square, postcode cb23pq. The phone number is 01223350914 and the entrance fee is 2 pounds.
Thank you so much! You gave me all the information I need today. I appreciate your time.
You're Welcome. Have a great day!
Good bye.
Thank you for contacting us.
Oh my! I totally forgot that I also need to find a place to stay. Can you find me an expensive place that is 3-star rated?
We have the Gonville hotel and the Lensfield hotel available. Which would you like to book?
Can I book one with free parking?
Both have parking, so you'll be set. Would you like me to try the gonville? How many nights were you interested in?
I would need a room for 5 nights, for 4 people please.
What day would you like to check in?
Monday would be great.
