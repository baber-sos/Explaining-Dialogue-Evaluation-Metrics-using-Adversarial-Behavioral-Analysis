I'm looking for a 2 star guesthouse in Cambridge. I am flexible on date. What would you recommend?
I was unable to find any 2 star rated guesthouses, do you have another preference?
Could you try again? It should be in the north as well.
No I am really sorry something else perhaps?
What about a guesthouse in the north?
I have found quite a number of matches, over 10, unless you have other specifications I would suggest the Worth House.
I really need something 2-stars. If there are no guesthouses that meet that, can you try a hotel please?
I have both the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge that meet your criteria. They are 2-starred hotels in the north area.
Do both hotels have free internet?
Yes, both have free internet and free parking. Do you have a preference between the two?
Yes, The Lovell Lodge sounds nice. Can you give me the phone number and postcode please?
Of course. The phone number of Lovell Lodge is 01223425478 and their postcode is cb41sr.
I also need a train for Sunday departing Bishops Stortford.
Do you have a time by which you would like to leave or arrive?
