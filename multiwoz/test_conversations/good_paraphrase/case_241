Yes I am looking for some hotels that include free parking and cheap rates in the Cambridge area.
There are 10 hotels, do you have any other preferences to narrow it down?
Sure. I'd like a guesthouse.
There are 9 options available. Do you have a preference for how many stars or what area specifically?
I don't care. Please book one that you recommend.
OK, how about the allenbell? To book a stay I'll need to know the first day you want to stay, how many days, and how many guests.
I need it for 8 people, and for 4 nights starting Saturday.
Great, I have booked your stay for 8 people for 4 nights. Your reference number is PB41WUOT . May I help with anything else?
I also would like to find a museum in the west.
there are several museums there, any preferences?
I would like to find the Museum of Science, please.
I'm sorry, but I'm having trouble locating your requested attraction. Can you please restate your request?
Is there a museum of science?
I'm not finding one, sorry.
Are there any other museums in that area?
Yes there are 7 museums in the west area of town for your pleasure. Is there anything else you would like to narrow them down with?
The museum I want should be in the west side of town and can I have the postcode for the museum.
Do you mean the Whipple Museum of The History of Science? If so, it's located in the centre of town. Postcode is cb23rh.
