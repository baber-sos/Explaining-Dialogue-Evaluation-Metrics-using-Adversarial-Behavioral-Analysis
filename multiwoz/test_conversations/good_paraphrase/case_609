Are there any cheap Indian restaurants available?
Definitely! I have 3 in the center and 1 in the north. I recommend Kohinoor, at 74 Mill Road City Centre.
Can you book a table for me there? Wednesday at 18:30, please, and I'll be dining solo.
Great! Your booking for Kohinoor was successful. The reference number is XJBRHRDC . Is there anything else I can do to help?
Yes, I am also looking for somewhere to go in the centre of town.
what type of attraction do you want?
What would you suggest?
I would suggest visiting one of the famous colleges.
I need a college in the centre of town
We have thirteen to chose from! All but three are free. Would you like me to list them for you?
