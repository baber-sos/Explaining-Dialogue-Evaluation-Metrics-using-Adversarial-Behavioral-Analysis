I'm interested in rooms for the night where you can get free wifi.
There are 32 hotels or guesthouses with free wifi. What price range are you looking for?
I'm looking for something in a moderate price range, but it must have at least a 4 star rating.
What part of town are you interested in? East, north or south?
I don't have a preference for the area.
