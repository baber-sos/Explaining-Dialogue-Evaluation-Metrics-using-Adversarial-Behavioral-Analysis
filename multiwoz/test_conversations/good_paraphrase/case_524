I need to get train ticket leaving cambridge after 14:45 please.
Ok I have a total of 1,365 entries that leave after that time. Do you have a specific day or destination you would like to select ?
I need to go to Birmingham new street on Monday.
I would recommend train ID TR5435 which leaves Cambridge at 15:02 and arrives at Birmingham New Street at 17:44.
What is the exact travel time on the TR5435?
