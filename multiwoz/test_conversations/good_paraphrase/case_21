I'm looking for a train that departs from peterborough and arrives by 19:30
Where would you like to go to?
I am going to Cambridge on Sunday.
There is a train that arrives at 19:09. Would that do?
Sure would. What time does it depart and how much does it cost?
leaves at 5:19 13.2 GBP payable at the station your reference number is CLPW6OR9
Thanks i appreciate your service. Can you also assist me with finding a place to stay? The Hotel should be a moderately priced 4 Star Hotel.
What area would you like to stay in?
in the south and preferably a 4 star which is moderately priced
Aylesbray lodge guest house meets all those requirements, would you like to stay there?
Yes, please. Can you book it for 5 people and 3 nights starting from the day we arrive?
Booking was successful. Reference number is : AXD7W0B9
