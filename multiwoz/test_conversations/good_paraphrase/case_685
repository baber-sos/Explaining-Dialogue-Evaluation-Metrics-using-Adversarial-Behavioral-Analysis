Hi I am looking for a restaurant in the centre of town serving Indian food.
That's great! There are several Indian restaurants near the city centre. Are you looking for a budget conscious option or are you comfortable with a more expensive place?
A cheap option please.
We have mahal of cambridge, the ghandi and kohinoor, do you want me to book you for one of those?
Yes please for 5 people at 12:00 on wednesday.
You are all set. They will hold the table for 15 minutes and your reference number is QLT7JB37
Thank you, appreciate your service.
No problem. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I am also looking for a hotel.
We have lots of great hotels. Would you like to stay with the centre part of town or some other area?
Yes, I would love to stay at a hotel in the centre of town. I need free parking, free wifi, and a star rating of 3.
The gonville hotel matches your criteria. Would you like me to book it for you?
yeah, that sounds good.
For how many people and how many days?
Is that a hotel? And what is the price range?
This is a expensive hotel
That sounds great what is their postcode?
The postcode is CB11LY. Are you still interested in booking a room? If so, I'll need to know how many people will be staying and for how many days.
