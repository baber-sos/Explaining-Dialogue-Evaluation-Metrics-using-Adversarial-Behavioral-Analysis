Yes, hello. I'd like to book a taxi to what I believe is a restaurant.
Sure, I can do that. Do you know the name of the restaurant? Also, when would you like to be picked up and arrive by?
Yes, Oak Bistro and will depart from Sheep's Green and Lammas land park fen causeway.
Ok great, I will also need to know what your preferences are for your pick up and arrival times to book your taxi.
I would like to arrive by 16:45. I will need a contact number and car type as well.
I have that booked, a red ford and the contact info is 07756177529
Great! That's all for today. Goodbye!
All right, thank you and have a great day.
