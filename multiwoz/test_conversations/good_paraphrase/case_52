Are there any guesthouses with 3 star ratings?
I was able to get four results for what you are looking for, is there a certain price range you would like?
Yes definitely. I would like something moderate.
We have four guesthouses that fit the bill, two in the north, one in the south, and one in the west.
Out of those, can you find me one with free internet and parking?
We have 3 that match your criteria but Hamilton Lodge is very popular. Would you like to try there?
No, I'm not ready to book just yet. Thank you!
