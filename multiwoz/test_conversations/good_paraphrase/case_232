I need help locating a place to go. Can you help?
Of course. What type of place?
I am looking for entertainment in the centre of town.
I hear the funky fun house is awesome.
Can I get the address. What is so funky about it?
It's a really fun house with lots of interesting things to do in it.
Interesting. Is it a museum?
Actually, for reasons that aren't clear to me, there are no entertainment attractions in the centre of Cambridge in our listings.
Okay. How about a museum instead?
I recommend the regency gallery, they have nice things. Would you like more information?
Yeah, I see them on the map but I need their entrance fee.
It is free admission for the Regency Gallery. Anything else for you today?
I need a train as well.
Okay! From where to where?
I'll be departing from cambridge and going to birmingham new street.
There are 133 trains departing from cambridge to birmingham new street. To help narrow it down what day are you travelling and what time do you want to depart?
Thank you, the train should arrive at 13:45 and leave on Monday.
I have train TR9195 leaving at 5:01 and arriving 7:44.
Please book it for 3 people on a Monday.
OKay I will work on booking this for you and be back with you shortly.
I need those reservations please.
