Hi there. Can you help me find a train to Cambridge on Thursday?
I can. Will you be departing from London Kings Cross?
No, I'm coming from Ely.
What time would you like to travel?
I would like to arrive in Cambridge by 16:15.
I would recommend the TR7745 train that arrives at 07:52. Would that work?
I need the travel time for that.
It is 17 minutes.
can you see about reservations at the aylesbray lodge guest house
Yes, I can. Will it be for for just 1 night?
