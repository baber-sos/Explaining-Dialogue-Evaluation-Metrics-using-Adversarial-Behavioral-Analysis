I would like to find a theatre in town.
sure, there are 5 options for you
Can you suggest one for me? I would like to know their postcode and entrance fee please.
Sure how about the Cambridge Arts Theatre. It's in the center of town and its postcode is cb23pj, but there is no entrance fee information listed.
I also need a train to Cambridge, on Wednesday please.
Sure, where will you be departing from?
I'll be departing from broxbourne. I'd like to arrive by 12:30.
TR1819 will arrive in Cambridge at 11:32. Would you like a ticket on that?
Yes, that would be great. I'll need tickets for 5 people. Can I have the reference number, please?
