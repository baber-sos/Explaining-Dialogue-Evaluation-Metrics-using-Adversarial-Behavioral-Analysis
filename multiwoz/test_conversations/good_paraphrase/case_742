Hi, I'm trying to find a moderate place to eat in the east. Can you help?
I've found a place called curry prince that fits that. Would you like me to place a reservation for you?
Actually I'm more interested in middle Eastern foods.
I have no listings for middle east food, another type maybe?
I think then that Indian place sounds nice, thank you.
