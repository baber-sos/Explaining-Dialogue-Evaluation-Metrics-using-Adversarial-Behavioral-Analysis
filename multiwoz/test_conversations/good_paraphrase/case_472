I am looking for information in Cambridge.
Since you contacted the help desk for cambridge I assumed this, can you please give me a starting point to begin a search?
Actually, I'll be needing to find a way to get to Petersborough. I was thinking a train might be cheaper.
yes it is
I need to leave Cambridge on Monday and get to Pererborough by 15:00.
Okay the TR2586 leaves at 14:06 and arrives by 14:56.
And how much does a ticket cost?
The ticket is 16.50 pounds.
And the travel time? I also need a museum to go to in the east.
