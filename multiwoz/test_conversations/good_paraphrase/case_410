I am looking for a attraction to see in Cambridge located in the centre
All Saints Church has some lovely architecture. Does that suit your needs?
It might. Can you please tell me the entrance fee, address, and phone number of All Saints Church?
Address is jesus lane,entry fee is free,and the phone number is 01223452587.
I also need a train to ely.
There are quite a few. Can you tell me what day and time you'd like to travel so I can narrow it down?
I need to travel Sunday after 11:00 from Cambridge.
I have train TR1159 that departs at 11:50 and will arrive by 12:07. Would that work for you?
