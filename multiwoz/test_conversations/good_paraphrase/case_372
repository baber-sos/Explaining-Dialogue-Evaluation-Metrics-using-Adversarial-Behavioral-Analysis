Would you be able to help me find a train for Friday?
Gladly. Where are you headed?
I need a train that departs Cambridge to Stevenage on Friday leaving after 18:30.
The first train running that route after 18:30 is the TR8118, leaving at 19:21.
That sounds great. Can you please book 5 tickets?
Booking was successful, the total fee is 64 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : QAF9QUO2 .
Okay thank you for your help.
I'm more than happy to have been of service. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I would also like to visit a college.
Do you have a specific college in mind? Or do you prefer a certain area of town?
I would like one in the centre please.
christ's college, corpus christi, king's college, and pembroke college are some of the colleges in that area.
Can I get the phone number, entrance fee, and postcode of one of them?
