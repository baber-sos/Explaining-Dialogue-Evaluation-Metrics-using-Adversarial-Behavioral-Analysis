i am looking for a place to go in the centre of town
We have 44 attractions in the city center. Is there any particular type you'd prefer?
Any special museums?
I have 11 museums. I could suggest the broughton house gallery it has a free entrance fee.
yes that sounds good can I get the postcode, address of that place?
The address is 98 King Street and Postcode is cb11ln. What else can I help you find today?
I'm looking for a guesthouse that has free parking included. Should be moderately priced, and have four stars.
carolina bed and breakfast is a 4 star guesthouse in the east part of town in the moderate price range with both free internet and parking.
Ok that sounds perfect please book that for 7 people for 5 nights starting from thursday.
A room has been booked. Your reference number is YGO4SXPA .
I also would like a taxi to get between those two places, please.
what time would you like to leave?
I'd like to leave my hotel by 1:15.
i have booked a yellow ford with contact 07869666997
Thank you that's all I need today, good bye.
You're very welcome. Thank you for calling Cambridge TownInfo centre.
And thanks again for your help. Goodbye.
