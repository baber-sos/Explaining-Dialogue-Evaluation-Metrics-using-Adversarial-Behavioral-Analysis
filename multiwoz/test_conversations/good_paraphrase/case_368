Can you let me know about 4 star places in cambridge? I want a personal touch, so a guesthouse who be perfect.
There are several 4 star guesthouses to choose from. What price range would you prefer?
Moderately priced will work. Also it should include free parking.
How does the acorn guest house sound? It is in the north.
Sounds good, could you book me a room for 1 person for 4 nights starting Saturday?
Your room has been booked. Your reference number is AVBX60NT . Is there anything else I can help you with?
No, that's all I need. Thanks for you assistance!
Thank you and have a wonderful day.
I'm sorry, I forgot. I am also looking for museums to see.
There are many museums in Cambridge. Is there a specific area that you would prefer? Also, do you prefer free or a cost for the museum?
Actually, I am not really familiar with the area. Would you mind suggesting one to visit? Anywhere in town is fine.
One of my favorites that I could spend all day in is Cafe Jello Gallery on the west side. Is there anything else I can help with?
Perfect, could I have the entrance fee and postcode?
The entrance fee is free and the postcode is cb30af. Is there anything else I can help you with?
No that will be all thank you so much.
You're very welcome. I hope you enjoy your visit.
