i am looking for all saints church in cambridge
All saints church is in the centre area on jesus lane. It is free to visit. Would you like more information?
address and entrance fee please ?
The church is at jesus lane postal code cb58bs and the admission is free. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Thank you! I'm also looking for the Warkworth House hotel.
Do you want to make a reservation there?
I don't know yet, what is it's star rating and postcode?
Warkworth house has a 4 star rating. Their post code is cb11ee
I also need to book a taxi to get to the attraction by 3:30 and I will need the contact number and car type.
