Hello, Im looking to book a train from broxbourne to cambridge
What day will you be travelling?
I am leaving on Sunday. I would like to arrive before 20:30.
The latest train that will arrive before 20:30 would be train TR1428. It departs at 18:32 and arrives at 19:32. Would that work for you?
Not right now but can you tell me the travel time for this train?
60 minutes is the travel time
