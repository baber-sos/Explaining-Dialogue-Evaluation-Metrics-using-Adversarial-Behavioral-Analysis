Hi, I'd like to find a place to stay that includes free wi-fi.
I have quite a few places that offer wifi, is there is a certain price range you are looking for?
Something cheap would be good.
I have about 10 different places. Do you have a preference on the area of town?
No not really. But I would prefer a hotel and like both free wifi and parking if possible.
The Cambridge belfry is a hotel in the west that is cheap and has both free internet and wifi. Would you like to book this?
That's fine. I'll need it for three nights starting on Sunday.
Unfortunately, that day doesn't work. Can we try booking another day or a shorter stay, perhaps?
Is there another hotel that matches that criteria?
Unfortunately that's the only hotel that suits your criteria.
I will try and restate so you can look again, I need free wifi and parking, cheap place, type of room does not matter.
There are 10 places that match your criteria. What part of town would you like to stay in?
It doesn't matter. Whatever is available nearby will be fine.
I will give it a try again. How many people will there be?
