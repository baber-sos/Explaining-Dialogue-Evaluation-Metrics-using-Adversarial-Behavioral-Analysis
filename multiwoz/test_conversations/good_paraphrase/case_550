I'm looking for an expensive restaurant that serves Thai food, please.
There is one in the west and one in the centre of town. Do you have a preference in area?
I don't have a preference in the area. I suppose you could book me a table for two people at 12:30 on Saturday. Also, could i get the reference number?
I booked you a table at the sala thong in the west area for 12:30 Saturday.
Thanks, please provide the reference number.
The reference number is XLRSFB9Q . Is there anything else that I can do for you?
