I'm looking for a place to dine that serves British food. It should be in the moderate price range.
How about The Oak Bistro? It's located in the Centre. Would you like more information or to book a table?
The Oak Bistro sounds fabulous. Can I get a table there on Sunday at 18:30? There will be 6 of us.
Booked! Your table will be held for 15 minutes. Reference number is HMWK23P8 .
