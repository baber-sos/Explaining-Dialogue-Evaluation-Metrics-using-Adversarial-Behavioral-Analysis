I need to find a guesthouse in the north.
I have about 11 different options. Do you have a preference on price range?
I would prefer that be expensive.
There are no expensive guesthouses however I do see moderate ones. Would you like to try one of those?
Yes,but needs to be a 4 star in the north
ok, there are 7 options. Would you like free internet or parking?
Doesn't matter. Book one of them for myself and 3 nights starting from wednesday.
Booking at the Acorn Guest House was successful, the reference number is O4BO1B0L . It is located at 154 Chesterton Road, Postal Code cb41da. Is there anything else I can help with?
Yes, can you help me find a train?
