I'd like to find a park attraction, please.
There are 5 options. What area would you like?
I would like an area near town.
All 5 of them are near town. In the centre area there is Cambridge University Botanic Gardens on Bateman Street? Will that one work for you?
Yes, what is the postcode and entrance fee?
The postcode for that is cb21jf and the entrance fee is 4 pounds. Can I help with with anything else today?
Yes, thank you for asking. Do you have a listing for a restaurant called the nirala?
