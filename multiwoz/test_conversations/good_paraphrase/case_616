I am looking for a cheap restaurant near the centre of Cambridge.
There are 15 restaurants that meet your needs. Would you like to narrow it down by cuisine?
Pasta sounds good. May I have the phone number for the top rated Italian restaurant.
I have the Zizzi Cambridge showing at 01223365599.
That sounds good. Also, I need info on a train. Leaving Friday and arriving at 19:45.
I found 294 trains arriving by 1945. What is your departure location and destination please?
The train should go to bishops stortford and should depart from cambridge.
I have 7 trains that arrive by 19:45. What time would you like to depart?
Can I have the train ID, travel time, and the departure time of the train that will get me there closest to 19:45?
