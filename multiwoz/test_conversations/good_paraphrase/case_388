I am looking for information in Cambridge.
Well you've come to the right place. What sort of information can I help you find?
A business partner told me about King's College and I was wondering if you could tell me a little about it.
King's College is a great place to visit. It is located in the centre and has no entrance fee.
Could you tell me their phone number?
Sure, their phone number is 01223331100. Is there anything else I can help you with?
yes, i'm looking for a train from birmingham new street
On what day could you like to travel?
I'd like to travel on Sunday, to Cambridge and leave after 15:30.
The TR6856 departs at 15:40 and arrives at 18:23. Would you like me to book that?
Yes, that would be helpful if you could book it! Can you make a booking for 7 people please? I'll need the reference number also.
You are all set, the reference number is YORG2CDA, can I assist with anything else?
