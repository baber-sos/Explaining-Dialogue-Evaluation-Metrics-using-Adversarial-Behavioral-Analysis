I'm looking for places to go in the centre.
Okay! Is there a particular type of place that you would like to visit?
No, surprise me! It should be in the centre.
How about King's College? Would you like more information?
Sure, could you tell me the entrance fee and phone number?
entry is free and phone number is 01223331100. anything else i can be of help?
What is the attraction type?
King's College is a college type attraction. What else can I do for you?
I could really use some help finding info on a guesthouse to stay in. I would need free parking though.
Sure. What area and what price range are you looking for.
It doesn't matter and it doesn't need to include internet.
for how many people and when were you planning your stay?
It will be 6 people, 3 nights from Wednesday on.
