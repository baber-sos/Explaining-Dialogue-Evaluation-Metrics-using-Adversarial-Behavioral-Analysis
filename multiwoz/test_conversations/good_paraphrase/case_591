I am looking for a centrally located upscale restaurant.
I can book you at the midsummer House Restaurant if you would like.
For 3 people, at 17:30 on Sunday. Reference number please.
Ok. I've booked your table. Your reference number is GVC0K9WU . Can I help with anything else?
Yes. I a place to stay. A upscale hotel please.
There are 33 hotels in that area, can you give me a price range and a star rating to narrow down the search?
I prefer upscale and want to stay in a hotel rather than a guesthouse. I also need free parking.
Huntingdon Marriott Hotel is located west and has 4 stars. Does this sound okay to you?
Does it have free parking? And internet?
Yes, the huntingdon marriott hotel has both free parking and internet. Would you like me to book a room for you?
Not right now. Can I please have the address and phone number of the Huntingdon Marriott?
