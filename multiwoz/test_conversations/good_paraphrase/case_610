I am looking for a restaurant that serves canapes in the east.
Unfortunately there are no restaurants serving canapes in the east.
Ah, well, too bad. In that case I think that'll be everything that I needed. Thanks and have a good day!
Are you sure? I can find other options in other parts of town?
How about italian food?
There is the pizza hut fen ditton in the east serving italian food.
Great! Please book a table for 6 at 16:15 on Saturday
Sorry, but no tables are available for that time slot. Would you like to change the time?
