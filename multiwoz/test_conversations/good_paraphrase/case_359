I'm looking for some hungarian food restaurants near the centre, please.
I am sorry there are no Hungarian Restaurants near centre.
What kind of expensive restaurants are in the center of town?
Unfortunately there aren't any Hungarian places. Do you want to try other cuisine types?
yes let me see the options
There is a variety of choices; Chinese, African, British, Italian, American, Gastro Pub, etc... Do you have a preference?
i want indian food.
Curry Garden is a nice place would you like that info ?
Yes can I get a address and phone number please?
Certainly, the phone number for the Curry Garden restaurant is 01223302330 and the address is 106 Regent Street City Centre. May I help you with anything else today?
Yes I am also looking for a place in the same area as the restaurant with free parking.I want it for 3 people for 5 nights starting Tuesday.
Would you like something cheap, moderate, or expensive?
That doesn't matter just a hotel in the same area with free parking.
There are two options here. Both are expensive. I recommend gonville hotel.
That would be great. Can you book it on Tuesday for 3 people and 5 nights.
Booking was successful, and your reference number is O4HVZDCW . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Perfect, thank you for all your help. That is all for now.
