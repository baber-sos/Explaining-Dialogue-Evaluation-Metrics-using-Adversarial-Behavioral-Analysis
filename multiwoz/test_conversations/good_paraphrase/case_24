Hi there, I'm looking for a place to eat that serves Indian food in the city centre. Do you have any good recommendations?
There are a total of 9 different Indian restaurants in the centre of town. Is there a particular price you are looking for?
No particular price range, but I do need a restaurant that is available to book 7 people on Friday at 19:15. I also need a reference number.
I have your reservation at the Curry Garden. It is an expensive restaurant on the centre. Your reference number is 24R72HY2 . Do you need their address?
