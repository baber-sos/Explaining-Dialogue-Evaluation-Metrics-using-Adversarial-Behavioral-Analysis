I'm looking for a place to stay in the north maybe a guesthouse.
You're in luck! I have 11 guesthouses in the north, would you mind sharing your price range and any other preferences you may have?
I'd like a place rated 4 stars, that offers free wifi.
That narrows the selection a little. Do you need parking?
No I just need free internet. I also need the price range, address, and postcode of the one you find.
The avalon is a guesthouse in the moderate price range and is located at 62 gilbert road, their post code is cb43pd.
I also need a train to Birmingham new street.
Sure, I can help you with that. When would you like to travel?
Friday, I am taking a half day at work to get an early weekend so after 14:00 please.
There is a 14:01 or if that's too close to 14:00 there is a 15:01 as well.
Pick one please, just please give me the travel time, arrival time, and price.
I would suggest the TR2519 which would depart at 15:01 and arrive at 17:44. This price is 75.10 pounds. Would you like to book this train?
Yes for one please.
I will work on this and be right back with you.
Ok. Were you able to book it?
How many tickets do you want?
for one please.
Booking was successful, the total fee is 75.09 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : 3D1AH8PM .
What was to total travel time for that train booking?
a total of 163 minutes
that is all for today thanks
