I am looking for a place to eat that's expensive and has Chinese food. Can you help me?
Sure. I have a number of different restaurants available. Do have a preference for the area?
I prefer a restaurant in the south.
You can choose from The Good Luck Chinese Food Takeaway or Peking Restaurant. Which would you like?

Sure! The postcode is cb17ag. Would you like to make a booking?
