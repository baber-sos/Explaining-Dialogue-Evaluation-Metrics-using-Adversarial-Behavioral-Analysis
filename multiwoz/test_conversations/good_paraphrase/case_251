I am in ely. I need to figure out how to get to cambridge by train.
What day would you like to travel?
I need to travel monday and arrive by 20:45
There are 8 trains that arrive before this time. The TR6679 arrives at 19:52, which is the closest to your requested time. Does that work for you?
Yes, that works for me. Please go ahead and book it. Thank you!
I'd be happy to book that for you, how many tickets do you need?
Just one ticket, I'm also looking for an attraction in the Centre.
Alright, train booked for you, your reference number is SM4XH1CM . Did you have a particular type of attraction in the centre you are interested in?
I'm looking for a college, actually.
