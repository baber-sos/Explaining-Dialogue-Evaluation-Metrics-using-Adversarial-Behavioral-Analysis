Hi! I'm looking for a place to stay with 3 stars that includes wifi.
I can help you with that. I have several options that fit this criteria. Do you prefer a particular area of town?
Just near Cambridge , and should be a guesthouse.
Bridge guest house is a guesthouse in the south in the moderate price range with free wifi and parking. Would you like to reserve a room?
Certainly. There will be 5 of us for 4 nights starting on Tuesday.
