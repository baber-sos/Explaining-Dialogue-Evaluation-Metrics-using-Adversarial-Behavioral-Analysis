Yes I am looking for a place to stay in Cambridge that is 3 stars and expensive. Can you help me?
Gonville Hotel is in the centre of town and The Lensfield Hotel is in the south.
Do those both have 3 star ratings and are expensive?
Those both do yes.
Do they have free parking?
Yes, they both have free parking. Would you like to book one today?
Not today thanks. I'm also want to find a cinema in the west part of town.
There are no cinemas located in the west part of town. Would you like me to look for cinemas in another area or a different type of attraction in the west?
Are there any colleges in the West that I could visit instead?
Yes, three of them are free to visit and there are two that have an entrance fee of 2.50.
What is the one that is free? Can I get the phone number and postcode?
Churchill College is free. The phone number is 01223336233 and the postcode is cb30ds. Do you need any other information?
No, that just about covers it. Thanks!
You're welcome. Thanks for using our service!
