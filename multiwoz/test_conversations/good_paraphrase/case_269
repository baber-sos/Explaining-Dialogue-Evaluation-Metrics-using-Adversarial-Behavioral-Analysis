i am looking for an expensive restaurant in the centre part of town.
There are 33 expensive restaurants in the centre of town. Did you have a type of food in mind?
Can you give me a couple of examples of different cuisines that are available?
There is African, Asian Oriental, British, Chinese, European, French, Gastropub, Indian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mediterranean, Modern European, North American, Seafood, Thai, and Turkish food available in the centre.
Let's go with Korean. What kind of expensive Korean restaurants do you have available?
Little Seoul at 108 Regent Street City Centre is very good.
That sounds good. Could I get the postcode for Little Seoul please?
The post code for little seoul is cb21dp.
I need the phone number and address of saint catherine's college and a taxi to commute both distance. Need to know the car type and also have the taxi number.
Okay! They are at King's Parade, CB21RL. Their phone number is 01223338300. What time would you like to depart in the taxi?
I need a taxi to commute between the two places. I need to leave the restaurant by 18:15 and need the contact # and car type
I've booked your taxi. You'll be looking for a red tesla. If you need to contact the driver, the number is 07464036678. Can I do anything else for you today?
No thank you.
Okay then have a great day!
