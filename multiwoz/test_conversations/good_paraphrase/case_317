I am looking for a restaurant that serves canapes in the east.
Unfortunately there are no restaurants serving canapes in the east.
Ah, well, too bad. In that case I think that'll be everything that I needed. Thanks and have a good day!
Are you sure? I can find other options in other parts of town?

Ouch! and would you consider selling another option in other parts of town?
