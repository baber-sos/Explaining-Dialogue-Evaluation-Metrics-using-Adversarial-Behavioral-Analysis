Hello, I am doing research on plant life in England, and visiting cambridge as part of that, can you give me more info on the cambridge university botanic gardens.
That sounds like an exciting trip! Cambridge University Botanic Gardens is located in the centre of town on Bateman Street. Its admission fee is 4 pounds.
That sounds perfect for what I am looking for. Can you tell me what type of attraction that is considered?
There is a beautiful park uniquely decorated with well scented flowers i bet you might have never seen. Do you want to buy an entrance ticket for that?
