I am looking for places to go in the centre of town.
There are 44 places to go in the centre of town. Do you know what you want to do?
Not really. Can you recommend a place?
If you like architecture, I would recommend Old Schools located on Trinity Lane. It is a nice place to visit.
That sounds wonderful, can you tell me what the entrance fee is for that?
They offer free admission. Is there anything else I can help with today?
Actually yes. I need high priced hotel with free wifi
there are 5 choices. to narrow down you need to choose the side of town you prefer
Area doesn't matter, but it should be a guesthouse with a 4 star rating.
unfortunately, nothing meets that criteria.
How about a guesthouse with a star rating of 4 that is cheap?
There are 7 options. I recommend Autumn House.
Sounds great, thanks! Can you please book it for 4 people, for 3 nights, starting Saturday?
Consider it done, you are booked, reference number is 2LDTCWH4 any other questions today?
No, thank you for your help.
Thank you for contacting us have a nice day.
