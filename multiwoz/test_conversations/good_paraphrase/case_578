I'm looking for info about a restaurant in Cambridge called Little Seoul.
Of course, the address is 108 Regent Street City Centre, postcode cb21dp. Did you want the phone number as well?
No, but I do want its area and price range.
Certainly, it is in the centre area and is in the expensive price range. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes can you help me find something to do in the center of town that involves looking at a college?
We actually have 13 colleges in the center of town! Downing College on Regent Street is free to get in and a great place to visit.
Could I get the phone number for Downing College?
No problem. They can be reached at 01223334860. Is there anything else I can help with?
