I want to find a brazilian restaurant that is cheap.
I'm very sorry, there are no results for cheap Brazilian restaurants. Would you like to try for a different type of cuisine?
Do you have any restaurants in the centre?
I have 5 different cheap restaurants in the centre. Three are chinese restaurants, and the other two serve asian oriental. Do you have a preference?
How about a Italian restaurant located in the centre
There are three in that area. Pizza Hut City Centre, Ask, and Zizzi Cambridge. Is there any more information you'd like about any of them?
No, which one would you recommend?
I've heard that Ask is one of the best in town. Can I reserve you a table there?
