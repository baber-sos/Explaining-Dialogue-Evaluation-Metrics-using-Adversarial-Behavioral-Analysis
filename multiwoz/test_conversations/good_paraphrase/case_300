I'm trying to find a cheap Asian restaurant to have dinner at tonight. What kind of options are available for me?
I have two places, how many people and what time?
Actually, can you suggest one of them. Can I get their contact info as well?
Sure, I would suggest the Dojo Noodle Bar at 40210 Millers Yard City Centre. You can reach them at 01223363471. I could reserve it for you.
No, that's ok, I can take it from here. Thank you for all your help.
