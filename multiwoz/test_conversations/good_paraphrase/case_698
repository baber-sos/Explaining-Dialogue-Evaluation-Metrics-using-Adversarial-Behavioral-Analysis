Yes, I am looking for theatres to go to in town.
We have five different theaters. Four of them are in the centre area and the fifth one is in the south area. Any area preferance?
Can you give me some info on the one in the south?
The junction is located on clifton way and im not sure of the entrance fee. The phone number is a 01223511511.
Thanks! I'm also looking for an expensive hotel. Can you help?
There are about 5 expensive hotels available. Are there any specific accommodations that you are looking for?
Yes, it should have free wifi.
Actually all 5 have free wifi. What star rating would you like?
