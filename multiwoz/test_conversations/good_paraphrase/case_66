Hi there. Can you help me find a train from Norwich to Cambridge?
There are several trains on that route. What time would you like to leave/depart?
I would like to leave after 12:15 on a Sunday.
I have a 12:16 departure from Norwich. Would you like me to book this for you?
I'm not sure if I need to book just yet. Can you tell me the travel time for this please?
Sure, TR5225 is a 79 minute trip and each seat costs 14.08 pounds. Can I help you with anything else today?
