I'd like some info on a restaurant, in the centre.
There are many great restaurants in the Centre. Is there a certain type of food you would like to have?
What do you have that is expensive?
Yes, there are many. Would you be interested in trying British cuisine? Or African?
British cuisine is fine. Can you suggest a restaurant?
Fitzbillies Restaurant meets all of your requirements. Would you like more info on them?
Book this for 6 people on Monday at 12:30. Reference number? Also, I need a train leaving from Cambridge going to London Liverpool Street, arriving by 12:00.
