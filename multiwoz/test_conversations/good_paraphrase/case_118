I am in need of an expensive Indian restaurant for dinner.
There are 14 such restaurants. Do you want to be in a specific part of town?
I don't care what part of town it is in, I would like a phone number please.
Sure, I'm sorry. I have Curry Garden their phone number is 01223302330. Would you like me to reserve a table for you?
Not at this time. I am looking for a 3-star hotel, though. No guesthouses.
I have found the Gonville Hotel. It is a 3 star hotel. Would you like me to book it for you?
Not yet. Is the Gonville Hotel in the same price range as the Curry Garden?
Yes, it's an expensive hotel.
Can you book a room for 2 people for 2 nights starting on Sunday?
The booking was unsuccessful. Would you like to try for another day or a shorter stay?
