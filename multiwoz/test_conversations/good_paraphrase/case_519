Can you help me find a restaurant that serves African food with a moderate price range please
I am sorry, there aren't any options available. May I ask if there is another type of restaurant you would be interested in?
Yes how about Asian food in the same price range?
Yes I have the Yippee Noodle Bar in the center of town on King street in the moderate price range. They serve Asian cuisine. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Will you please book a table for 6 at 13:45 on Friday?
