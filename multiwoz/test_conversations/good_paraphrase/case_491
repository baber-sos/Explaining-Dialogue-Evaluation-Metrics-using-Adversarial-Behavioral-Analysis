Im looking for an italian restaurant. I also need it to be near the center of town.
There are 9 italian restaurants in the center of town. Do you have a particular price range in mind?
i need a cheap restaurant
There is Pizza Hut City Centre, Ask, and Zizzi Cambridge, which would you like to book?
Can you book a table for 7 at Ask? We're looking at 14:00 on Saturday.
Sorry, there are no tables available at Ask at that time. Would you like to book another day or time, or perhaps another restaurant?
Can you try 13:00, then?
13:00 it is. Your table at Ask will be held for 15 minutes, and your reference number is L2KZYL26 . Can I help you with anything else?
I'm also looking for a hotel
We have 33 different hotels. Did you have a price range or star rating in mind?
Something in the cheap price range including free parking
What area would you prefer to stay in? This will help narrow down your options.
I would like to book a hotel close to our restaurant here in the centre, it will also need to be cheap, and have free parking.
There are two hotels available. Would you like me to book one for you?
Yes please. The our group of 7 will all be staying there for 3 nights starting Saturday.
I've booked you a 3 day stay at the Alexander Bed and Breakfast for 7 people. Do you need anything else?
Could I have the reference number for that reservation please?
Yes, your reference number is 1JBO1R08 .
