I am planning a trip in Cambridge
Would you like to come by bus, or train?
I'm actually looking for a particular attraction called the fitzwilliam museum.
Yes nice place. Did you need any info on it ?
What type of attraction is that?
It's a museum. Will that be all?
Thanks. I do actually need help finding a train. I want to go to London Kings Cross on Monday.
