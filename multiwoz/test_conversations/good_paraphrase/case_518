Hi. I'm looking for a 4 star hotel in the east.
There are no 4 star hotels in the east side of town. Would you be interested in staying at a guesthouse instead?
Yeah, a guesthouse is what I'm looking for actually.
There are 6 guesthouses in the area. What is your price range?
I don't have a particular price range in mind. What do you suggest for 8 people and 5 nights? I will need it for Wednesday.
I would recommend Autumn House on 710 Newmarket Road. It has Internet and Parking and is cheap. Does that sound good?
Yes and also looking for places to go in town. The attraction should be in the centre and should be in the type of museum
