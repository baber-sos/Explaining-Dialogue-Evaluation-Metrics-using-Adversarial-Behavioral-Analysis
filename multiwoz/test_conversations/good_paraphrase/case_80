I'm looking for a restaurant that serves canapes food. Expensive range should do it.
Unfortunately there are no canapes restaurants.
hmmm. Can you check again? it should be in the centre.
I am sorry but there are no restaurants that fit that criteria in the centre.
Could you try a restaurant that serves british food instead?
Yes, we have three British restaurants in the central area. Might I recommend fitzbillies restaurant?
That sounds fine, can you reserve a table for 3 people at 13:00 on Tuesday?
