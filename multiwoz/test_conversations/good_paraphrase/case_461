I'm looking for a restaurant in Cambridge called Nandos City Centre.
Nandos city centre is located at 33-34 Saint Andrews Street.
I want to book a table for 4 people at 15:00 on wednesday. Please give me a reference number.
Sure thing! Your reference number is LYIENP77 . Can I help you with anything else today?
I need to find a guesthouse style hotel please.
The a and b is a guesthouse style hotel in the east area.
What is its star rating? I am looking for a place with a star of 0.
I have results for 2 guesthouses with 0 star ratings, one is in the north and one is in the centre. Which area do you prefer?
Which one has free parking and wifi? I will need a phone number, price range and area as well please.
The city centre north b and b has parking and wifi. It is in the north area. Would you like to book this hotel?
I don't want a booking. Just give me the phone number and price range, please.
The City Centre North B and B has a cheap price range. It's phone number is 01223312843.
That's all I need. Thank you!
