I am looking for a cheap hotel with free parking near Cambridge.
I have multiple cheap hotels with free parking. What part of town are you interested in staying in?
I'd like to stay close to the center area, but the hotel should be 3 star.
We do not have any hotels that match your search. Do you want to try something else?
Are there any moderate 3 star hotels with free parking?
We do not have any hotels that match your search. Do you want to try something else?
How about one in the moderate price range?
We have 3 entries that match your preferences. Would you prefer north, south, or west?
I don't have a preference but I would also like ot find a restaurant called the Cow Pizza Kitchen and Bar.
Before I book your restaurant would you like to book your lodging? I think you will like Hamilton Lodge. It meets your needs.
Does it have internet?
Yes, the Hamilton Lodge has internet.
Sounds great. What is the address and contact information?
Hamilton lodge is located at 156 chesterton road postcode cb41da. Their phone is 01223365664. Would you like me to book a room for you?
That's not necessary, thank you. You could, however, find me a restaurant a friend mentioned. I think it was called the Cow Pizza Kitchen and Bar.
The Cow Pizza Kitchen and Bar is a moderately priced gastropub in the centre of town. Would you like a reservation?
May I have the address for The Cow Pizza Kitchen and Bar please?
The address is Corn Exchange Street. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I would like a taxi for the hotel by 13:45 to get to the restaurant please.
I have booked a taxi to arrive at the hamilton lodge by 13:45. The contact number is 07214110599.
What is the car type for the taxi?
The taxi is a Red Audi
