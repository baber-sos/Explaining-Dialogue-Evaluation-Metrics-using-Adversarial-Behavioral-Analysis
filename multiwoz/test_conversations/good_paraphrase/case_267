Can you help me find an Afghan restaurant on the west side of town?
There are no listings for an Afghan restaurant on the west side. Would you like to try a different area or cuisine?
Try a different cuisine. Just an expensive restaurant.
I have restaurants specializing in thai food, indian, european or british food. Which would you prefer?
