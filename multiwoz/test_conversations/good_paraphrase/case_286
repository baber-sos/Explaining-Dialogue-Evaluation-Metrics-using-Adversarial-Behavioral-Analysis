Where would I find the museum of archaeology and anthropology?
The Museum of Archaelogy and Anthropology is located at University of Cambridge, Downing Street. Their phone number is 01223333516. Do you need anything else?
And the attraction type is a museum, right?
Yes, it is a museum.
Sounds great. Thank you for the info!
