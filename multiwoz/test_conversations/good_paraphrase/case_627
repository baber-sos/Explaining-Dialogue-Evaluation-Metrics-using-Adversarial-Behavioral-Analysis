Would you help me book a train today?
I would be happy to. Where are you traveling?
to broxbourne on Wednesday. I would like to leave after 13:30.
TR5164 departs Cambridge Wednesday at 14:01 and arrives in Broxbourne by 15:01. Would you like to book a ticket?
That sounds just perfect. Can you book us 5 seats on that train?
Yes, I will book 5 tickets for you.
Can you give me the reference number please?
Reference number is : 2GRQX8N4 . Anything else?
Yes, I need a place to stay in, preferably something moderately priced.
Sure, do you have a preference in the area of town?
I would like to stay in the east. I prefer a hotel, if possible.
There are no hotels that meet that criteria in the east but we do have 3 moderately priced guesthouses available. Would one of those work?
