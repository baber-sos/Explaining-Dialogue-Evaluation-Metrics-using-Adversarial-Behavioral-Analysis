I'm looking for a hotel to stay at that has free wifi and a 4 star rating. Do you have any suggestions?
Acorn guest house is in the north with wifi and a 4 star rating.
That sounds great but I was hoping to stay in the south. Do you have anything else?
Yes I have two guesthouses in the south. One in the moderate price range and another in the cheap price range. Do you have a preference?
No, I'll take your recommendation. Can you give me a phone number and postcode? Oh, and how expensive is it?
Rosa's Bed and Breakfast is cheaply priced and is absolutely gorgeous. The phone number is 01223512596 and the postcode is cb22ha. Would you like me to book a room?
Not now. But can you tell me something about concert halls in the west?
Sure thing, there are none.
How about a college in the same area?
