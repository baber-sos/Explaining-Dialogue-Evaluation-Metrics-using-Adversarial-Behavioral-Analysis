I am traveling to Cambridge and can't wait to see some attractions. I am interested in a particular attraction.
Okay! What is the name of the attraction that you are interested in?
It is Trinity College. Can you tell me a little about it?
Sure it is one of Cambridge's most famous colleges and has a 1 pound entrance fee and is located on Trinity Street in the center of town.
Thanks. I also need a cheap place to stay while I am in town.
I have 10 hotels in town matching that requirement ranging from 0 to 4 stars guest houses and hotels. Do you have a preference for the area?
it should be in the east and have free wifi
great, i have 3 options for you!
Give me the cheapest option please and book it for me
That would be for the Leverton House. What day are you wanting to stay and how many guests?
Monday, for 2 nights, 2 people. I'll need a reference number. Also, I need a taxi to college by 4:00. I need the contact number and car type.
Reference number is : XIMION2S, for the hotel. You also need a taxi?
