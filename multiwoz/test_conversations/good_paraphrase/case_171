Hi I am looking for a restaurant in the centre of town serving north indian food.
We don't have any specific restaurants in that category. Let's try something else?
That's too bad. How about Chinese?
Okay sure what do you have?
Okay when you find something I would like to make a reservation for 2 people on a Sunday at 13:30.
Do you have a price range in mind?
I don't mind about the price range.
Okay, how about lan hong house? It is a chinese restsurant in the centre area and is in the moderate price range. Will that work for you?
