I'm looking for a park in the centre of town.
Cambridge University Botanic Gardens is the park you are looking for then. It charges and entrance fee of 4 pounds .
Can I have the phone number?
The phone number is 01223336265.
I also need a train leaving on Sunday.
Got a destination or departure site in mind?
I would be departing from cambridge and going to the airport.
What time would you like to leave or arrive?
I want to arrive by 10 AM.
I have several options would you like me to book something for you?
No, I would just like to know how much the tickets are and how long the trip lasts.
Okay the price for a train ticket will be 8.08 pounds for 28 minute ride.
