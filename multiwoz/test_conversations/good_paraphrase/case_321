Could you help me find a place for entertainment? Something on the east side of town.
Cherry Hinton Hall and Grounds is on the east side of town, would you like their phone number?
Actually, can I get the address and postcode?
Yes, it's Cherry Hinton Road, cb18dw.
Can you tell me what the entrance fee is?
I'm sorry, the entrance fee isn't listed in my system.
OK, then that's all I need today. Thank you for your help!
