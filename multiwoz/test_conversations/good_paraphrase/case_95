It's Sunday and I am bored. Do you have any trains into Cambridge today?
There are many trains, when would you like to depart?
I would like to leave from Kings Lynn after 9:30.
TR5928 leaves at 10:11, would you like me to book that for you?
Can you give me the price of a ticket?
Tickets are 7.84 pounds. Can I book that for you?
Great I also need to find a place to stay that doesn't need to have free parking and is in the cheap price range.
There are 33 hotels in the cheap range, any preference on area or anything else?
Cheap price range in the centre.
There are two choices. Alexander Bed and Breakfast and El Shaddai. Do you want to make a reservation at one of these choices?
I will take Alexander please.
To confirm you want me to book you a room at Alexander Bed and Breakfast starting on Sunday. How many nights will you be staying?
