I am looking for information about the Ruskin Gallery in Cambridge.
The Ruskin Gallery is a museum in the center of town.
Ok, great. Thank you so much for your help.
Thank you for using our service!
Real quickly, actually. Can I get a train booked as well? For Thursday to cambridge.
Of course. There are 202 trains into Cambridge this Thursday. Where will you be departing from, and what time would you like to arrive?
I want to arrive by 17:45
Where will you be departing from?
I'm coming in from the london liverpool street station.
There are potentially 7 trains that fit your needs. When do you wish to depart London Liverpool?
Please give me the train ID of the train that arrives closest to 17:45, I don't care about departure time.
Train TR8944 arrives at 15:39, will that work for you?
Yes, thank you, you have given me the information that I needed.
Will you be needing anything else today?
