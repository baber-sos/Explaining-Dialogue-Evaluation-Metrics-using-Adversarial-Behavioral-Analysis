Hi. Have you heard of a hotel called Warkworth House?
Yes ma'am. I have the Warkworth House guesthouse on Warkworth Terrace, with is the east section of the city. Can I help book a reservation for you?
Can I get the price range on it?
Warkworth House falls in the moderate price range. Would you like me to book a room for you?
No, that's all the information I'll need for now. Thanks so much!
You're very welcome. Can I find you a restaurant, or help in any other way today?
