Hi I need to find a place to stay with a 3 star rating with free parking
There are 6 four star hotels in Cambridge. Do you have a preferred price range?
Could you find me a one that is cheap?
There is none that is cheap. Would you like to change your criteria?
Could you give me the lowest price of the 6 hotels currently available?
There are no cheap hotels available with 3 stars and free parking. Do you want to try a different price range?
What about cheap 4 star hotels?
I have 7 guesthouse and the cambridge belfry hotel that meet your needs. Would you like to book one?
