Thanks you, Im think of doing something after I eat, are there any good entertainment places in the east area?
Yes, there are quite a few good places. Was there a certain type of entertainment you were interested in?
The attraction type is entertainment, in the east area, please.
I found two attractions that match your request: Cherry Hinton Hall and Grounds and Funky Fun House.
Cherry Hinton Hall sounds good can I get the phone number, address, and postcode.
