I need help finding the Aylesbray Lodge Guest House. Would you be able to give me the address and phone number?
Absolutely. The phone number is 01223240089 and is located at 5 mowbray road.
Could you also let me know the star rating of the hotel, phone number and I'd also like to know if they have wifi.
The Aylesbray Lodge Guest House has four stars and free internet.
I am also looking for a restaurant called the Michaelhouse cafe.
The Michaelhouse Cafe offers expensive European cuisine in the center of town.
Wonderful! Thank you for your help.
