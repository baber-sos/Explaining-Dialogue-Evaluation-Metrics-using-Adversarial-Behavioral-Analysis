Yes, I will book 5 tickets for you.
Can you give me the reference number please?

Yes, I need a place to stay in, preferably something moderately priced.
Sure, do you have a preference in the area of town?
I would like to stay in the east. I prefer a hotel, if possible.
There are no hotels that meet that criteria in the east but we do have 3 moderately priced guesthouses available. Would one of those work?
yes. could you provide the postcode and star of the hotel.
Okay, the carolina bed and breakfast is a 4 star rated guesthouse and its postal code is cb13nx.
