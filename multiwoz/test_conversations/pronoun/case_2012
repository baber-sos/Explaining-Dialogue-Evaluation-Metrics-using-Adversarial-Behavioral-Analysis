Hello, I would like to find a hotel that includes free parking.
Most of the hotels in town offer free parking. Is there a certain area you'd like to stay in, or do you have a price range in mind?
Yes. The centre would be nice and also free wifi.
The University Arms is an expensive, 4 star hotel with free wifi. Comparatively, the Alexander Bed and Breakfast is a cheaply priced guesthouse, also 4 stars.
Please book me some rooms for The University Arms to accommodate 8 people for 3 nights starting on wednesday. Can you also provide me the reference number after you book?
Your reference number is X5NY66ZV .
Thank you. Can you please help me find a place to go in town in the same area as the hotel? Preferably a college.
There are no colleges close to the area you are requesting, would you like to chose another destination?
I believe there are some colleges in the centre of town. Can you please check again?
I am sorry but I rechecked and there are no colleges in that area. Is there anything else that I can do for you?
Hmmm, I was looking for the phone number and postcode of a college in the centre area. Could you help me with that?
I have 5 colleges in the centre area. What specific college are you looking for?
I'm looking for cambridge.
I'm sorry, there are no listings for cambridge college in the centre area. Is there another college you would like me to look for?
Oh, it could be anyone then. Just a college.
How about corpus christi college, they have a free entrance fee.
Could you give me their phone number, postcode, and entrance fee?
The phone number is 01223334900, the postcode is cb23bu, and the entrance fee, as mentioned earlier, is free. Can I help with anything else?
Thank you very much. That's all I need today, bye.
