Hello, I am doing research on plant life in England, and visiting cambridge as part of that, can you give me more info on the cambridge university botanic gardens.
That sounds like an exciting trip! Cambridge University Botanic Gardens is located in the centre of town on Bateman Street. Its admission fee is 4 pounds.
That sounds perfect for what I am looking for. Can you tell me what type of attraction that is considered?
There is a beautiful park uniquely decorated with well scented flowers i bet you might have never seen. Do you want to buy an entrance ticket for that?
Uh...no thanks. Can you help me find a train going to Stevenage?
Where you will be traveling from and when would you like to leave?
The train should leave after 09:30. depart from cambridge and should leave on tuesday
The earliest train after that time is TR6009. It departs at 11:21 and arrives in Stevenage at 12:10. Would that work or do you prefer a later train?
That sounds fine. How long will the travel time be?
The travel time is 49 minutes. Would you like a ticket?
Yes, Please book me a round trip ticket and can you locate a cheap diner.
What type of food would you like?
I do not need a ticket booked. I do not need anything else. Thank you.
Are you sure you don't need anything else?
No that is it. Thank you.
Ok. thank you and goodbye
