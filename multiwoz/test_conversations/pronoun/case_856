I am planning a visit to Cambridge very soon and need some information about types of lodging available.
There are 33 places to stay at. Would you like a cheap one?
No, I want an expensive hotel with free wi-fi.
How about the express by holiday inn cambridge, it's in the east.
Does it have free parking?
Yes it does. Would you like to go ahead and make a reservation?
No thanks, but could you provide me with their postcode?
Certainly. The postcode is cb13lh.
Thank you. Would it be possible to find a train for me as well?
Sure. Let me start by getting more information from you. What are your departure and destination cities?
I need to travel on saturday from cambridge to london kings cross and need to leave after 18:30
Train TR0427 leaves at 19:00 on Saturday and will get you there by 19:51. The cost is 18.88 pounds. Want me to book it?
