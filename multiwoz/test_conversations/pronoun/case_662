Hi, I need a train that departs from bishops stortford and leaves on monday.
I have 10 trains available. What is your destination and preferred departure and arrival times?
My destination is cambridge and needs to arrive by 15:00.
I would recommend TR1827 which leaves Bishops Stortford at 13:29 and arrives in Cambridge by 1407.
What would the price range be for that?
The price is 10.10 pounds. Would you like me to book that train?
No but I need information on places to go in the centre of town.
We have a lot of things to do in the centre. Is there a particular type of attraction you're interested in?
Can you suggest something?
What about a museum? The regency gallery is amazing and it's free!
Sounds good. Can I get the phone number and postcode?
Sure the phone number is 01223365454 and the post code is cb11er. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
