Thank you so much for your help.
Do you need help booking a ticket on that train or with anything else?
I want to make a booking for 7 people, and I need the reference number. Also, I need to book an expensive guesthouse.
The fee for the train tickets is 125.29 GPB which is payable at the station. Your reference number is 42CZLF04 . Is there a specific guest house you have in mind?
I don't have a specific one in mind. I would like something expensive though.
I don't have any expensive guesthouses listed. Would you like to try a different price range or a hotel instead/
