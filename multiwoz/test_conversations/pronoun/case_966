I need help finding a place to dine in the expensive price range and serves british food, can you help me?
I have 6 restaurants that are serve british food and are expensive. Is there a certain area you would like?
Any of them you recommend would be fine. I do need a booking for saturday.
Sure thing, what time and party size would you like to book on saturday?
