I would like a train to Cambridge that leaves after 17:00.
There are very many trains that fit your requirements, where are you leaving from and what day would you like to leave?
I'd like to leave on Monday from Stansted Airport.
Ok, there are 7 trains that fit those requirements, can you tell me what time you would like to arrive by?
I don't mind we can get there any time.
TR4096 leaves at 17:24 and arrives by 17:52, would you like me to book a seat for you?
Yes can you give me the travel time?
Sure, I was able to book your seat and your reference number is 4EIV9UFN which is payable at the station. The travel time is 28 minutes.
Thanks! Also, could you tell me if there are any places in the center of town that serve british food? Something expensive would be great.
There are 3. How about fitzbillies restaurant? Should I book you a table?
Yes that sounds great, I need a table for 8 at 20:45 on Monday please.
Unfortunately that time is not available do you have another time you'd like to try?
