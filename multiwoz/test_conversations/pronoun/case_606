I need a train that is departing from cambridge and should leave on sunday.
Where will you be going?
I will be going to ely and I would like it to arrive by 11:45.
Train TR2475 leaves at 07:50 and arrives by 08:07 on Sunday. Would you like to book this now?
Could I have the price for that train please?
They are 3.52 pounds each
Yes could you book that for me?
Yes, I can book that for you. Can I confirm that this is for one person, or do you need more than one ticket?
Please. I am also looking for a museum in the east please.
In the east we have four museums cambridge artworks, cambridge museum of technology, gallery at twelve a high street and saint barnabas press gallery.
Could you tell me the entrance fee and address for the Cambridge Museum of Technology?
