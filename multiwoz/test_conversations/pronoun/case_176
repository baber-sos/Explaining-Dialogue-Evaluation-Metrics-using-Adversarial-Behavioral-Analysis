Hello, I am looking for information on a train.
I can help you with that. Where are you headed?
I'm headed to Cambridge from the Stansted Airport. Can you find information for Thursday please?
I found 19 trains what time do you want to leave the airport?
I need to arrive in Cambridge by 14:45 so I will need to leave in time to get there by then.
There is a train that leaves at 5:24.
That won't work, I need to arrive in Cambridge by 14:45 (2:45pm).
Since that won't work for you, I can get you on a train that leaves at 13:24 and will arrive by 13:52. Would you like me to book your seat?
That would be just fine. I just need the Train ID for now. I also need a place to stay.
Yes, that train ID is: TR3637. Can I assist with a booking?
No, I don't need to book it now. Can you help me find an expensive guest house with free parking and wifi?
Sorry, I don't see any listings that match your search. Would you like to change price range or type?
Are there any in the moderate price range?
The Acorn Guest House is in the moderate range.
Alright tell me the star rating, phone number, and postcode for that location
Acorn Guest House is a 4 star establishment located at 154 chesterton road with postcode cb41da and phone number 01223353888. Can i assist you any further?
I would like to book a room at that hotel. Can you go ahead and book that for me.
Sure. I need a little information first. How many guests will this be for?
