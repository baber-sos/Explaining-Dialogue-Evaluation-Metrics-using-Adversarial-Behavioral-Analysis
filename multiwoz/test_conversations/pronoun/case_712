I'm looking for somewhere to stay with free parking and free wifi.
There are 29 places that meet your needs. Do you have additional preferences such as lodging type, price range or area?
Something cheap would be more within my budget. What do you have available?
There are 9 guesthouses and 1 hotel that fall in that price range. Is there a particular part of town that you'd like to stay in?
I don't care about the area. Just pick one for Monday.
How long do you intend to stay?
We will be staying for five nights.
Is it just you staying?
No, it will be me and a friend. We will be staying for 5 nights and arriving on Monday.
