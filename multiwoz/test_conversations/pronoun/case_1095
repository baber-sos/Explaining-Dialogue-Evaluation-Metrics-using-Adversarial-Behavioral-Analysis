Hi, I'm trying to find a moderate place to eat in the east. Can you help?
I've found a place called curry prince that fits that. Would you like me to place a reservation for you?
Actually I'm more interested in middle Eastern foods.
I have no listings for middle east food, another type maybe?
I think then that Indian place sounds nice, thank you.
Can you tell me the day and time you'd like to eat, and how many people I should book the table for?
Yes. I'll be needing a table for 8 on Sunday at 12:15.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : APWDPYEL .
Thank you I will take it.
You're welcome. Do you need anything else?
I'm actually also looking for a place to stay. I would like it to be 2 stars and have free wifi.
I have 3 hotels matching your request in the north and east and in the expensive and moderate price range. What part of town and price range would you prefer?
If it narrows it down, can I also have free parking as well?
I have 2 hotels in the moderate price range and one in the expensive price range. Which would you like information on?
