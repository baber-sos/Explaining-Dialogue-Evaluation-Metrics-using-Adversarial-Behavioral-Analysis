I'm looking for a train that leaves on tuesday to cambridge, please.
kindly narrow down your specifications so that i can find you a train that suits you best, like time of arrive and departure
I want to depart from Stevenage and would like to arrive in Cambridge by 16:30.
What time would you like to leave at?
I don't care about departure time as long as I get there before 16:30.
Alright, TR1830 arrives by 14:43, does that suit your needs?
Yes, I think that will work. Can I get the price and departure time for that train?
It costs 12.80 pounds and it leaves at 13:54. Would you like me to book you seat?
No thanks. No booking for today. Can you help me find a place to stay.. a hotel maybe?
Do you have any other preferences?
Yes, a hotel preferably with free parking.
We have 8 hotels with free parking, such as the 4 star Huntingdon Marriott in the west. Is there any particular price range or location you need?
I don't care about the location, but I would like to be in the moderate price range.
That narrows it down to 2 choices. I have the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge. Both are hotels located in the north. Both have a 2 star rating.
