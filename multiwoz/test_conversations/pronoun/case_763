Hi, I am looking for a cheap place to stay that has free wifi. Can you find anything like that?
I have ten entries that meet your requirements! What area of town would you like?
I don't care about the area but I need one with 3 stars, please.
Unfortunately, I don't show any cheap hotels that have a 3-star rating. Can I look in a different price range or star rating for you?
Can you see if there are any in the moderate range?
We have 3 moderately priced 3 star guesthouses.
Great! Which of those three would you recommend?
Which are would you like to stay in?
Please just pick the best one and book it for Thursday.
I'm going to book you for bridge guest house, but I need to know the number of days you plan to stay and the number of people with you.
Sure, 2 people, checking in on Thursday for 3 nights please.
Your booking is successful! Your reference number is IZE1WK61 . Can I help you with anything else?
No that is all, thanks.
You're welcome. Thank you for calling. Enjoy your trip!
