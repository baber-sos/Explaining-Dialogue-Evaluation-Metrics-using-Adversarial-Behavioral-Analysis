I am hoping to arrive in cambridge by 12:30.
I have 13 trains meeting your criteria. The first leaves at 05:19 and leave every 30 minutes after. Can I book one of them for you?
What is the one with the shortest travel time?
All the trains take exactly 50 minutes. What time would you like to depart?
Hm, I'll take any train that will let me arrive by or before 12:30.
