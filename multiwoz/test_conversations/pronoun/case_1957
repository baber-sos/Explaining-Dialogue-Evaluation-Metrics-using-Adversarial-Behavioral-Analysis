I'm looking for something fun to do on the east side of town.
Funky Fun House is my favorite place on the east side! I don't have any information on the entrance fee, but their phone is 01223304705.
Can you please give me the address?
Yes their address is 8 mercers row, mercers row industrial estate.
Can you book tickets for me?
