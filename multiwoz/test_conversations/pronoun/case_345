I am looking for a place to go while in Cambridge. I would like something to do with boats? Do you have that?
There are four different locations related to boating, is there any specific area you're looking to go to?
No there is not, just please provide me with the address of one that you recommend.
The Cambridge Punter, the address is 251a Chesterton Road, post code cb41as. Would you like to know any more info on boats in Cambridge?
I'm looking for a place to stay. I prefer a guesthouse that's expensive.
There are not any expensive guesthouses in Cambridge. Would a moderately priced guesthouse suffice?
No. I really need an expensive one with 4 stars. I don't care about the area. Can you check again for me?
Unfortunately there are no guesthouses that match your request. If you are willing to stay at a hotel, I have 2 expensive 4 star options.
Do you have cheap guesthouse with 4 stars available?
We have 5 guesthouses that is all in the cheap price range. All have free internet and parking. 3 in the eastside, 1 west, and 1 centre.
Can you book the one in the centre for 7 people for 3 nights starting Monday?
Unfortunately the Alexander bed and breakfast guesthouse is unavailable for that date range. Would you like to see if another day is available or book for a shorter stay?
Can you try booking for one night, instead?
Booking was successful. Your reference number is 5HDLTHO7 .
I also need to arrange for a taxi to leave from the hotel and get to Cambridge Punter.
What time do you need the taxi?
