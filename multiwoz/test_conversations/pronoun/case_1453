Hi, can you help me find a 4 star place to stay?
There are a total of 21 hotels and guesthouses in the city that have 4 stars. Is there a particular area or price range you would like?
How about a place in the east side of town that is a hotel not a guesthouse
I am sorry but I do not have any hotels in the east. Would you like to change location or type of accomodations?
Yes, can you please change the location to centre?
We have one 4 star hotel that is in the centre, University Arms Hotel, it has internet and parking and is expensive, would this one suit you?
That will be fine. Can you book me a room for Saturday, please?
Certainly. How long would you like to stay, and how many are in your party?
