I am looking for an attraction in the centre, preferable a boat
Ok, there are two options for you. There is Scudamores Punting Co and The Cambridge Punter.
Which one of those two is located in the centre?

Can I get the address, entrance fee and phone numbers for both?

I am also looking for an expensive place to eat around there. Can you offer a recommendation?
the bedouin is an delicious expensive restaurant in the centre serving african cuisine!
I would prefer european food. Is there one in the area? Please book a table for 2 at 15.15. I need the phone number and postcode please.
I have three that match your criteria. Would you like to try Eraina? The phone number is 01223368786 and the postcode is cb23rh.
Sure. First I need to know where the taxi should pick you up.
When would you like to arrive by or leave at?
I need to leave the attraction by 24:00. And I need a contact number and car type please.
To clarify, you want a taxi from the scudamores punting co to the bedouin, leaving the scudamores by 24:00?
