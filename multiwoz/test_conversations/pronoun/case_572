Find me a train to kings lynn that arrives by 20:15.
The TR3112 arrives at 05:58. Will that work?
Is it on Saturday?
I'd suggest TR7604, it departs at 19:11 on saturday and arrives by 19:58. Would you like a ticket?
Yes, I definitely would. Can I please have the confirmation number as well?
How many people will be traveling?
No, that's ok. No need to book it, but can you tell me the price of the ticket?
