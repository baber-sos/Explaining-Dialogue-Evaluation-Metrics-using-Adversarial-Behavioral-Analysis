Please help me find a hotel called Flinches Bed and Breakfast. Thanks.
It's phone number is 01223276653 and is located in postcode cb30nd
Thanks. I'd like to book a room for 6 people, for two nights on thursday.
You're all set. Your booking was successful and your reference number is VMI0R4J4 . Anything else I can help with?
We will also need to catch a train that is going to Cambridge. Any trains that will put us in Cambridge by 12:00?
There are many trains that will fit your schedule. Where will you be departing from and will you be traveling on Thursday?
