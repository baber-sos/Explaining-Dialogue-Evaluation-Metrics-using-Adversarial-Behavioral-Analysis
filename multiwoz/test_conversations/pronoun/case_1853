It is a moderately priced guesthouse on the east side of town. It does not offer free parking. Do you want more information?
yes book it for 4 people and 3 nights starting from thursday.
Ok. I was able to complete the booking. Your reference number is 3PQEENI7 .
Wow, thanks. Could you please also find me a college to visit in the centre area?
There are 13 colleges in the centre. Many of them are free. Would you like me to suggest one?
Is there one you would recommend?

This is great. Thank you for your help.
You're welcome; is there anything else I can you with today?
