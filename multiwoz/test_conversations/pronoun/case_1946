I am looking for a place to stay in Cambridge. I prefer it to be in the north and include free wifi, please.
Do you have any other specifications?
Yes, if you could find a 4 star hotel with free parking that would be great.
Sorry there are no 4 star hotel fitting that description. Anything else?
Can you list alternatives close to 4 star with free parking?
What type of alternatives would you like to know about?
