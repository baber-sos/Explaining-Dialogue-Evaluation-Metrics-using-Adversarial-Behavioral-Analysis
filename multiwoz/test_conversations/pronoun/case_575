I need to make a train reservation for Friday and I need it to arrive by 19:00
Sure, I can help with that. Can you please let me know where you will be departing from.
I will be departing from Cambridge.
And what is your destination?
I will be going to stansted airport.
Train TR7213 departing from cambridge at 05:40 and arriving at stansted airport at 06:08 will be the best option for you.
That's an early arrival. Is there a later train that arrives before 19:00, please?
There is another train that arrives at 18:08. Would that work better for you?
Yes, that would work. Could you book it for 5 people?
