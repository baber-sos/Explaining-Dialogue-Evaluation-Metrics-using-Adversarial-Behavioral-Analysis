Hi, I would like to book a hotel in the north side of the city. Do you have any recommendations?
There are two hotels in the north. Both are in the moderate price range with Wi-Fi and parking. The ashley hotel is very popular. Should I book it?
I need free parking, and like a guesthouse over any other type.
If you like guesthouses there are a lot more options for you. I could recommend Archway House, they're moderately priced but rated four stars. Does that sound good?
Yes, it does. Could you see if you could book a party of 8 for 5 nights beginning Thursday?
I was able to book it, reference number is MFIGB1D2 .
Thank you very much, I would also like help with a train booking going to Leicester.
I will be more than happy to help you. Are you leaving from cambridge and what time and day will you be going?
Yes it should and I would like to arrive by 18:00
What day would you like to travel on?
I would like to travel on Tuesday.
the TR7007 leaves cambridge to leicester on tuesday leaving at 05:21
That sounds like it would work. Can you tell me the cost of the ticket?
TR7007 costs 37.80 pounds. Would you like to book that train?
No thank you. That's all the information I need to enjoy my trip to Cambridge!
Should you need anymore help, please reach back out to us.
