Yes I am looking for a place to stay in Cambridge that is 3 stars and expensive. Can you help me?
Gonville Hotel is in the centre of town and The Lensfield Hotel is in the south.
Do those both have 3 star ratings and are expensive?
Those both do yes.
Do they have free parking?
Yes, they both have free parking. Would you like to book one today?
Not today thanks. I'm also want to find a cinema in the west part of town.
There are no cinemas located in the west part of town. Would you like me to look for cinemas in another area or a different type of attraction in the west?
