I am looking for a brazliian restaurant in the centre.
Sorry, I couldn't find any food of that type.
There are no Brazilian restaurants anywhere in Cambridge?
No, their are not any. Would you like to pick a different type of food?
Yes, what about british food please.
what price range are you comfortable with?
Something in the moderate price range would be good.
Do you have a preference as to what area of town you dine in?
Yes, the centre is preferable.
How about The Copper Kettle? It's located in the centre and moderate price range.
Sounds good! Please book a table for 6 people at 13:00 on Monday.
Your table has been booked. Your reference number is S59IHPUI . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Thanks. Yes, I also need a train from Cambridge to Ely, please.
Those trains run every 2 hours, starting at 05:50. What time would you like to depart?
