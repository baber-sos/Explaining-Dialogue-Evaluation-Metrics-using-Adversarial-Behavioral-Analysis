I want to find a theatre in town to go to. Do you have any suggestions?
I think we can help with that. I have five theaters listed. Which part of town are you in?
Anything in the centre of town available?
The adc theatre is in this area.
What is the cost to get in? I need the postcode and the phone number as well.
Their phone number and post code are 01223300085 cb58as rspectively, and I have no information on their entrance fees.
I also need a reservation for 4 at 17:00 on Thursday at an Italian restaurant in the moderate price range. Please provide the reference number after booking.
I have several italian restaurants, did you want to stay in the centre area?
No, just as long as it is in the moderate range would be good.
Okay, I recommend Prezzo in the west. Would you like their information?
