I would like to find an architectural attraction to go to in the centre. Can you help me?
Yes! I found 5 attractions matching your requirements. Would you like to know more?
I would like to get the entrance fee and address of them please
Great saint mary's church is 2 pounds and the other 4 are free. Would you like the address for great saint mary's church?
Yes, that would be great.
The church is located in Market Square postcode cb23pq. I do not have access to the full address.
Okay thank you. That is all I needed.
OK, can I help with any other travel plans?
We are looking for a place to dine, preferably expensive Italian food in the same area as the attraction. What do you suggest? I need an address and postcode please.
