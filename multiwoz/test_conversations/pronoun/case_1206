i'm looking for things to do in the west.
There are many options available in the west, what types of attractions interest you?
A museum perhaps?
I'd recommend the cafe jello gallery. Their phone number is 01223312112. Can I help you with anything else?
Sounds quite interesting. Can I get their address please?
Yes the address is cafe jello gallery, 13 magdalene street, postcode cb30af, admission is free so best price of all.
Thanks! i'm also looking for a place to stay with 2 stars.
I have three hotels that meet that criteria, two moderately priced in the north, and one expensive in the east. Which do you prefer?
I'm looking specifically for a guesthouse, and one that has free parking. I'm renting a car to sightsee.
there are no guesthouses with free parking
Do any of them have parking?
arbury lodge guesthouse has parking, its a 4 star and in the moderate price range
No, I'd like a 2 star hotel instead. Any recommendations?
I found three 2-star hotels with parking. Two of them have a moderate price range, while the other is expensive. Does this help narrow it down?
I'll take the expensive one. What's the name and can I get their phone number please?
