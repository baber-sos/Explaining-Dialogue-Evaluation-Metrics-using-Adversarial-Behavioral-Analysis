I would like a train to Cambridge that leaves after 17:00.
There are very many trains that fit your requirements, where are you leaving from and what day would you like to leave?
I'd like to leave on Monday from Stansted Airport.
Ok, there are 7 trains that fit those requirements, can you tell me what time you would like to arrive by?
I don't mind we can get there any time.
