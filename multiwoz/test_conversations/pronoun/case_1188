Yes. I would like to book it for 6 people please.
Your booking was successful, the total fee is 226.8 GBP payable at the station. Your reference number is: 17I15NSK . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Yes I also need a guesthouse to stay in. It should have 4 stars, free wifi, in the east location.
