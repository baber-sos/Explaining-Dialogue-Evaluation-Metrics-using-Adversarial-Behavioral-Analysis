For eight riders, and please include my reference number.
Booking was successful, the total fee is 78.4 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : FB2585PK .
Thanks. I'm also interested in some sort of entertainment in the centre.
How about Vue Cinema? Or the mumford theatre?
Vue Cinema, what is the entrance fee and address for that location?
The address for Vue Cinema is the grafton centre, east road. I apologize but I do not have information on their entrance fee.
Do you happen to know if there is a nightclub in the centre?
Yes, we have FIVE nightclubs in the centre of town. Is there a particular one you're looking for?
I don't care which one you recommend, but can you tell me the entrance fee and address?
