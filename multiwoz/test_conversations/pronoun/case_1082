Can you get me information on a hotel called huntingdon marriott hotel?
Sure! It is an expensive 4-star hotel in the West area of town with internet and parking. It is on Kingfisher Way, in the Hinchinbrook Business Park in Huntingdon.
Sound like a decent enough place. Would you be able to reserve me a room for Monday?
