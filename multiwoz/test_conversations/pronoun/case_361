I'm looking for a pool somewhere in the south of Cambridge.
I'm sorry, but it doesn't look like we have a pool that matches your criteria.
How about some type of theater?
The Junction theatre is in the south area. Would you like the address?
Yes, please provide the address and postcode as well.
The Junction Theatre is located on Clifton way at postcode cb17gx. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Thanks. Yes, I also need to find a guesthouse for my stay there.
Are you needing the guesthouse in the south, also? Do you have a preference in price range?
The area should be the centre. I need it to be cheap and have free parking.
I have 2 guesthouses that fit your criteria. One is The Alexander bed and breakfast and the other is El shaddai.
