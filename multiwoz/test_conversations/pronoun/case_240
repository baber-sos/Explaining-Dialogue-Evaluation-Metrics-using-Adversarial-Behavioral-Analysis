Yes, can you tell me information on Cambridge lodgings? We are looking for free wifi and a nice guesthouse.
Sure. What area and price range are you looking for?
I don't really care about area or price range, the most important thing for me is free wifi in a guesthouse that has free parking.
I've got over 20 guesthouses that will work with those requirements. Would you like me to book a moderately priced 4 star?
As long as it has free wifi and parking then yes.
I would recommend the Acorn Guest House on the north side of town. It has 4-stars. Should I book this?
Yes. Please book it for 8 people for 5 nights starting from sunday.
Ok. You're all set for the Acorn Guest House on Sunday. The reference number is RLSL7BTI . Can I help you with anything else?
Can I get a train from Leicester to Cambridge? Should be on that same Sunday and I'd need it to arrive by 20:30.
There are several trains you can choose from. Train TR1079 leaves at 09:09 and arrives at 10:54. Would you like to book it or try another?
You can book that one. I need the booking for 8 people. Could I get a reference number?
I've booked your tickets. The reference number is 3ENDA3IC .
Great! Thanks for your help today. I'm all set. Goodbye.
Thanks for using our service. Take care. Bye Bye.
