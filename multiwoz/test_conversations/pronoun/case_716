What's your favorite college to visit in Cambridge?
I like Christ's College in the center of town, but there are many others throughout the city. What part of the city did you want to visit?
I think I would like to visit that location, It seems nice. Could I get the phone number and the area?
The area is centre and the phone number is 01223334900. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Actually, I'm hungry. Can you find me a restaurant that serves north american food? Something not super expensive, maybe in a moderate price range?
I'm sorry, there's no restaurant serving specifically north american or american food in my database, is there another type of food you would consider?
How about modern European food?
There are three modern european restaurants two in the center and one in the south. Do you have a preference?
I would prefer the one on the centre, could I have the phone number and postcode please?
de luca cucina and bar's phone number is 01223356666. Postcode is cb21aw.
Could you help me get a taxi to get from the college to the restaurant?
What time would you like to leave the college? I can book you a taxi to take you to the restaurant if you'd like.
I would like to leave at 12:45.
I have booked you a taxi leaving at 12:45. The car will be a red toyota and contact number is 07350032543. Anything else today?
