I am looking for an expensive restaurant in the centre.
Oh there are many here in the centre! Did you have a particular cuisine type you were interested in?
I'm looking for a restaurant that serves chinese food.
We have four such places.
If you could find me one and if I could get the address, that would be great.
How about Sesame Restaurant and Bar at 17 Road City Centre?
Sure, can i have their postcode, number and address?
The Sesame Restaurant and Bar is located at 17 Hills Road City Centre, postcode cb21nw, and their phone number is 01223358899. Can I help with anything else?
Yes, I'll also need somewhere to go while I'm in town. Can you find me an attraction in the same area as the Sesame Restaurant? I'd like to visit a college.
There are many options in the centre of town. Do you have a type of attraction in mind?
A college please. I'll need the entrance fee, postcode, and phone number for the one you suggest.
