I'd like to find out if there are any cheap portuguese places to eat in Cambridge.
Yes, I have Nandos located in the South and Nandos City Centre located in the Centre. Will one of these work for you?
Yes, I will make a reservation at Nandos in the south part of the city for five people on Thursday.
I can certainly help you with that. What time would you like the reservation?
I would like the reservation to be at 14:45.
Your reservation reference number is : SMH06MS1 . The table will be held for 15 minutes from the time of your reservation. May I assist you with anything else?
I need a place to stay as well. I need free parking.
I have over 20 different options for you, was there a certain area or price range you would like me to find for you?
Lets see what is available cheap, same area as the restaurant makes most sense but i am open to any area.
I have one place in the cheap range, in the south area. Would you like me to go on with booking?
What kind of food is it?
They serve portuguese. Need a reservation?
Sorry I have the restaurant. I am looking for a cheap, four star hotel with free parking and internet.
Rosa's Bed and Breakfast meets your criteria. Would you like to book a room?
Do they have internet?
Yes, they do have internet. Would you like to make a reservation?
No, could you just give me the area that is in and postcode please?
Sure! It's in the South part of town, and the postcode is CB22HA. Can I help you with anything else?
