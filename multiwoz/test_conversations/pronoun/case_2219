I want to find an Italian place to eat near the center of cambridge.
There are nine possibilities to choose from. What price range do you have in mind?
I would like for the restaurant to be expensive.
I'd recommend Don Pasquale Pizzeria. Would you like more information on them or to book a reservation?
