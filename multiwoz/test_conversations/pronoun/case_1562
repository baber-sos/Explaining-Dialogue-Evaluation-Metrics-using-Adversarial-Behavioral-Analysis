Hi! I'd like to find a restaurant located in the centre please.
There are 69 restaurants in the centre- did you have a preferred cuisine type?
Modern European, please, and I'd like someplace moderately priced.
There are two restaurants that fit your criteria which are de luca cucina and bar and riverside brasserie. Which one do you prefer?
