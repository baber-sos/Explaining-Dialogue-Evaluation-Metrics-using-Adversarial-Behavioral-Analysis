I am looking for information in Cambridge
I can help book a hotel if you need it!
I'm actually looking for a train. I'm leaving from Cambridge on Friday.
I will be happy to help with that! Where are you travelling to?
I need to travel to ely.
We have 10 trains going to Ely on Friday. Do you have a time you want to arrive or leave by?
I'd like to arrive by 18:00. Any that do that will be fine. I'll need a train ID, departure time, and travel time, please?
The TR5844 departs at 15:50 and has a travel time of 17 minutes. Would you like me to book it for you?
