What time would you like to depart?
Are you looking for a train or a taxi?
I am looking for a train from Cambridge to London Kings Cross for Wednesday, arriving by 09:45.
I only have a train that arrives at 07:51 or 09:51.
would you please book for 8 people? and give me the reference number
I booked 8 tickets on TR1058 leaving Cambridge at 07:00. The reference number is VBKUUA4S and the total fee is 188.8 GBP payable at the station.
Thanks, could you also help me find a good museum to visit while I am there?
There are 23 museums listed. Is there an area of town you prefer?
Surprise me with one. I just need the address.
I can do that. Try the Whipple Museum of the History of Science, on free school lane.
Thank you! As always you are amazing. That is all I need for today.
