I am planning a trip in Cambridge
I can help book a train to get you here.
Ok I will book it for you
How can I help you today? Are you needing train information or is there something else I can do for you?
I need an expensive place to stay that's 2 stars.
I show two hotels in the north, 1 is expensive and 1 is moderate. I also show 1 expensive 2 star hotel in the east. Which area do you prefer?
Do any of them have free parking?
express by holiday inn cambridge has free parking. That looks to be the only option available.
Great, thanks! Which area is it in?
Its on the East side. Would you like me to book you a room there?
No, thanks. I just need to now the postcode.
Okay the postcode is cb13lh.
