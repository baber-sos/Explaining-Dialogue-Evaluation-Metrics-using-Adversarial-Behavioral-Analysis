I am looking for a place to dine. The restaurant should be expensive and should serve Chinese food.
Would you like the restaurant in a specific place?
Not in any specific area please. I need to book a table for 3 at 14:00 on Saturday.
Unfortunately, it looks like all the options are booked for that day/time. Would you like me to change the time or possibly the day?
how about 13:00 then?
Yes, I can book you at the yu garden for 13:00.
What is the reference number for my booking?
