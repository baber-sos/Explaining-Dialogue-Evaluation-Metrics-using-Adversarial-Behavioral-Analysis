Hello. I'm looking for a moderately priced four star hotel in Cambridge. Can you make some recommendations?
There are 11 4-star hotels within your price range. Do you need internet and/or parking?
I need internet but not interested in parking
The acorn guest house may be a great option.
If there are no hotels, a guesthouse would be fine, I suppose.
Could you like me to book that for you?
Yes please, I need to book for 5 nights starting saturday for one person. Could you please provide me with a reference number after booking?
