Hi, I want to travel to Cambridge by train.
Great, what time do you have in mind?
I want to arrive by 17:30.
And where are you leaving from?
I'm leaving from Broxbourne on Sunday.
The first train departs Broxbourne for Cambridge on Sunday at 05:32. Do you want to purchase this ticket or pick a later departure time?
Can you book for arrival closer to 17:30 for one person and give me the reference number. Also I would like to see a college in centre.
I found you a seat on TR4658 departing Broxbourne at 15:32, arriving Cambridge at 16:32. The total fee is 14.32 GBP payable at the station, and your reference number is H88LTKWC .
I'm also looking for a place to go maybe a college.
There are many colleges,what area do you want?
