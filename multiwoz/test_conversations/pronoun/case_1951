Yes I am looking for a place to eat in south Cambridge that is more on the expensive side.
Yes there are 5 different places that serve 4 different types of food.
I would prefer vegetarian food.
Unfortunately, there is no expensive vegetarian restaurant in that area. Would you like to look for something else?
