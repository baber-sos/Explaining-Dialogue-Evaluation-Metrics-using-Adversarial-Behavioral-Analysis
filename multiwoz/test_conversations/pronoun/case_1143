I need a train from Birmingham New Street that will arrive by 18:15.
I can certainly help you with that. Where are you traveling to?
I wish to go to Cambridge on a Wednesday.
The first train leaves at 5:40.
That sounds good for me. Could you please get me 6 tickets?
Booking was successful, the total fee is 450.6 GBP payable at the station. Your reference number is WX15FBX1 . Is there anything else you need today?
Yes please. I'm also looking for information on The Cambridge Punter.
The Cambridge Punter is a boat in the centre, the phone number is 07807718591. Do you need more information?
I think that is all I need to know.
Great. Well you have a wonderful day!
