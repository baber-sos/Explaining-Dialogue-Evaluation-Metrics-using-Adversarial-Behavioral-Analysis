I'm so bored! Can you find me something to do in the centre of town?
If you are into contemporary art, Cambridge Contemporary Art is a great place to relieve boredom. The address is 6 Trinity Street. Best of all, there isn't any entrance fee.
Thank you that sounds great.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes, actually. Can I ask for help finding a train for Monday going to Cambridge?
Where would you be departing from?
I'll be leaving from King's Lynn and I need to get to Cambridge by 8:45.
The best option that will get you to Cambridge by 8:45 is probably train ID TR8950. It arrives in Cambridge at 7:58.
Perfect, can I book that train for 2 people? Once booked, can you send me the reference number please?
