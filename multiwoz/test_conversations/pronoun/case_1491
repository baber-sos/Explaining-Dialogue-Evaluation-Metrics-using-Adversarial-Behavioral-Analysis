I'd like to find out if there are any cheap portuguese places to eat in Cambridge.
Yes, I have Nandos located in the South and Nandos City Centre located in the Centre. Will one of these work for you?
Yes, I will make a reservation at Nandos in the south part of the city for five people on Thursday.
I can certainly help you with that. What time would you like the reservation?
I would like the reservation to be at 14:45.
Your reservation reference number is : SMH06MS1 . The table will be held for 15 minutes from the time of your reservation. May I assist you with anything else?
I need a place to stay as well. I need free parking.
I have over 20 different options for you, was there a certain area or price range you would like me to find for you?
Lets see what is available cheap, same area as the restaurant makes most sense but i am open to any area.
I have one place in the cheap range, in the south area. Would you like me to go on with booking?
