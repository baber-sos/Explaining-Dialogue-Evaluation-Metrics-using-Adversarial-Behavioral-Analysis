I am looking for a place to stay. Could you find me a place in the centre of town that is expensive?
There are 2 hotels in that area that are in the expensive price range, one is a 3 star and the other 4 star. Which one would you prefer?
I need it to have free wifi and free parking. Does one of them offer both?
Yes, they both do. May I recommend Gonville hotel?
