Hi! Can you help me find some places to go on the south side of the city? I'm super bored!
I am happy to help. There are several types of places to go in the South. Parks, theatre, cinema, museum, nightclub. What sounds good to you?
I don't have a preference. Could you make a recommendation?
How about a nightclub or cinema? There's also a great museum.
Anything is fine whatever is most popular.
Sure, Cineworld Cinema will be great. What information do you need about this attraction?
Can I get the address, entrance fee and attraction type please?
The address is cambridge leisure park, clifton way. It is a cinema. I do not know the entrance fee, unfortunately.
I am also wanting some information on a hotel called the Kirkwood House. Can you tell me about them?
That is a guesthouse found in the North. It is in the moderate price range and is rated four stars. Do you need their contact details?
I need a booking there for five people staying three nights from Monday.
Excellent. You are all booked. Reference number is J0VGU1UX . Can I help with anything else?
Yes. I need a taxi to commute between the two places. I'd like to leave the park by 01:15.
You are booked with a taxi going from cineworld cinema to kirkwood house w/yellow skoda . Your contact number is 07191555645. Would you need anything else?
That should be all! Thank you for your help! Good bye.
