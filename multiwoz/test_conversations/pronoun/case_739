I'm looking for a train from Cambridge to London Kings Cross.
When would you like to arrive by?
I would like to arrive by 08:15, and leave on Monday.
I have 2 trains that meet your criteria. One train arrives by 5:51, and the other by 7:51. Would you like to book one of these?
Yes I would like to arrive at 7:51 please for 8 people, I need the reference number
Booking was successful, the total fee is 188.8 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is: 31K4BK2E . Is there anything else you need?
