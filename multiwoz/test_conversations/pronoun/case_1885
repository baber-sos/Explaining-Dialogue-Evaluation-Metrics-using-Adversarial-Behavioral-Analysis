I am looking for a hotel in the west of Cambridge.
I have huntingdon marriott and the cambridge belfry. Both have 4 stars and offer free internet and parking. Would like to book a room?
That won't be necessary. Are they cheap?
The huntingdon marriott hotel is in the expensive price range. I have the cambridge belfry also in the west in the cheap price range. Would you like to book?
Yes please, as long as internet and parking are free. There are 7 of us arriving on Wednesday for 5 nights.
I have made the reservation. The reference number is 51B4Z8I7 . Is there anything else you need today?
