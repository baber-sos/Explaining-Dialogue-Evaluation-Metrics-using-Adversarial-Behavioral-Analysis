I am looking for a restaurant called loch fyne
That is a nice seafood restaurant located on Trumpington Street. Can I reserve a table for you?
Can you tell me a little more about the place? I need to know what type of food they serve, price range and where it's located.
It is an expensive restaurant. They serve seafood and they are located at The Little Rose 37 Trumpington Street.
