I am looking for a train headed to london liverpool street.
I can help! What day are you traveling?
On tuesday - the train needs to arrive by 14:45 too.
Five trains match your request. The first train leaves at 05:59. Do you want a seat on this train or do you want to see additional departure times?
Yes, I do want a seat on the train. Please give me the train's ID.
That would be train TR7299. Would you like me to book you passage?
Not right now, thanks. I am also looking for some places to go in the west area of town. What attractions do they offer there?
There are colleges, entertainment venues, and museums in the west.
Oh, a museum would be lovely! What kind are available?
There are 7 museums in the west. One has an entrance fee and the rest are free.
can you give me the postcode for one of the art museums?
Certainly. The Lynne Strover Gallery's postcode is cb30aq. Can I help you with anything else?
