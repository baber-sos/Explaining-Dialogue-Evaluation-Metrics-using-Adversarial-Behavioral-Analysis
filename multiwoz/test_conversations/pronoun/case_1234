Hello, I need to book a ticket going to Cambridge arriving by 16:30, can you help me with that?
There are a lot of trains available. Where are you departing from?
I'm departing from broxbourne on Friday.
TR2145 looks like it will get you there with plenty of time to spare.
Thanks, could you let me know the departure and arrival time?
