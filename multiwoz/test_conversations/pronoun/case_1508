I am looking for something to do in the centre of town.
There's so much to do in the centre of town. There are museums, boats, concerthall, cinemas. What are your interests?
I think a theatre sounds nice.
I have the Adc Theatre on Park Street. Would that work for you?
Yes, that would be great. Can you give me the phone number, address, and postcode.?
Their address is Park Street, postcode cb58as. Their phone number is 01223300085. Can I help you with anything else?
Yes, I need a train for sunday.
What are your departure and arrival stations, and what time of day would you like to travel?
