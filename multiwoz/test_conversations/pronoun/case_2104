I am also looking for the regency gallery attraction. Could you please provide me with information about it including the phone number?
Of course. It is a museum in the centre. Their phone number 01223365454. Can I tell you anything else?
Yes, I will also need to book a taxi to leave the restaurant by 22:15.
