I want a place to dine in the south that is expensive.
We have several options that include Chinese, Indian, Italian, and Mexican. Which one do you prefer?
I'm looking for a restaurant serves traditional food. Are there any nearby?
There are no restaurants in the south serving traditional food. Would you prefer something different?
How about Mexican food? Can you check on that for me?
Sure! We have the Chiquito Restaurant Bar located in the south serving Mexican food. Would you like to make a reservation?
Yes please. I need reservation for 6 people at 1400 on wednesday.
I have a table for 6 reserved for you on Wednesday at 14:00. They will hold the table for 15 minutes. Your reference number is DKBLDY07
Thanks. I also need to find a train for Thursday.
OK, what are your departure and arrival stations, and what time of day would you like to travel?
