I need a train to Cambridge on Monday.
Can you tell me where you will be departing from?
I am leaving ely I need to arrive by 11:15.
TR2987 leaves Ely at 9:35 and arrives in Cambridge at 9:52. Would you like to book a seat?
Is there a later one that would still get us there by 11:15? I need 4 seats.
That is the latest train for that day. Is that okay?
Ok. You can book that one for 4 people.
Booking was successful, the total fee is 17.6 GBP payable at the station . You Reference number is : E3F6RPQB . Can I help with anything else?
i'm also looking for a restaurant
There are many, many restaurants to chose one. Can you help me narrow it down?
Yes, I am looking for the Curry Garden.
Sure. Curry Garden is located in the city center and is expensive and good. Would you like me to make a reservation for you?
