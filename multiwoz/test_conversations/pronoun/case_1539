What's your favorite college to visit in Cambridge?
I like Christ's College in the center of town, but there are many others throughout the city. What part of the city did you want to visit?
I think I would like to visit that location, It seems nice. Could I get the phone number and the area?
The area is centre and the phone number is 01223334900. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Actually, I'm hungry. Can you find me a restaurant that serves north american food? Something not super expensive, maybe in a moderate price range?
