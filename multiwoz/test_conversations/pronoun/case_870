Are there any expensive hotels around?
Yes, there are 5 such hotels. Do you have a location preference?
I do not have a location preference.

I would like an expensive hotel with a star of 4. It should also have free parking and free wifi.
I have 2 hotels. The Huntingdon Marriott and University Arms. Both are 4 star rated. Huntingdon is in the west, and University Arms is in the centre.
Lets book the University Arms please
Sure thing, what nights will you be staying?
3 nights starting on tuesday
I can help with that. How many people will be staying?
There will be 4 people.
Booking was successful. Reference number is : 5INDNYF8 . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
I also need to find a place to go located in the west.
We have a bunch of stuff out that way. What type are you looking for?
Any attraction is fine, thanks! I just need the address of whatever place you choose.
How about Whale of a Time? It's an entertainment attraction in the west. The address is unit 8, viking way, bar hill.
