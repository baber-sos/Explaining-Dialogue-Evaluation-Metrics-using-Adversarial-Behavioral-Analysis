Hi, I need a train on Sunday leaving peterborough.
I have 38 trains leaving peterborough on sunday. Where are you headed?
I am hoping to arrive in cambridge by 12:30.
I have 13 trains meeting your criteria. The first leaves at 05:19 and leave every 30 minutes after. Can I book one of them for you?
What is the one with the shortest travel time?
All the trains take exactly 50 minutes. What time would you like to depart?
Hm, I'll take any train that will let me arrive by or before 12:30.
Booking was successful. Departs at 11:19 and arrives at 12:09, that will be 13.2 GBP payable at the station, your reference number is QS1AJEL1. Anything else I can help you with?
I need a hotel, one with free parking.
There are a lot of possibilities here but none indicate free parking, just whether they have parking or not. Could you list places with free parking?
I need an expensive hotel that includes free parking.
Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge is an expensive hotel located in the east, and it includes parking. Would you like me to book a stay there for you?
I want to book this hotel for the same group of people and 3 nights starting from Sunday. I'll need a reference number please.
Your reservation is confirmed and the reference number is ##
I'm sorry? Were you able to book the Express by Holiday Inn for 4 people?
