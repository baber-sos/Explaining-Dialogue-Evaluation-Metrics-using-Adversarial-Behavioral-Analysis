Can you help me find a train going to Peterborough that leaves after 08:45? Thanks!
I can absolutely help you with that, what day will you be planning to travel and where will you be departing from?
I am leaving from Cambridge on Sunday.
TR3211 leaves Cambridge at 09:06 and arrives in Peterborough at 09:56. Would you like me to book you a ticket?
I actually need 3 tickets. Please provide a reference number.
I booked you 3 seats on the TR3211 train departing Cambridge at 09:06. Your reference is YU1AWA94 and 39.59 GBP is due at the station. Will that be all today?
I am also looking for the hotel A and B guest house.
What would you like to know?
Do they include wifi, and can I get the postcode and phone number?
The A&B Guesthouse does offer free wifi! And the phone number is: 01223315702. The postcode is: cb12dp.
Thank you, that's all the information I need today.
I hope you enjoy your stay in our city!
