I am interested in booking a train to cambridge for next tuesday.
There are several trains departing for Cambridge on Tuesday. One train departs every hour starting at 06:08
I would like to depart from birmingham new street after 14:45.
There are 9 trains that depart from Birmingham new street to Cambridge on Tuesday after 14:45. The earliest is 15:40, does that work?
Yes, that works! I would like the reference number please.
How many tickets do you need?
6 people please.
Great, your reference number is TYGH2E4A, and the total fee payable at the station is 450.6 GBP.
Great! I also need an expensive restaurant in the west that serves Persian for the same day and party as well please.
Unfortunately, there are no expensive Persian restaurants in that area. Would you like to look for something else?
