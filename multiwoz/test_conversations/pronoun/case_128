I'm planning a trip to Pembroke College.
Great! Pembroke College is in town. What information can I help you with?
I'd like to know what type of attraction it is, the entrance fee, and what area it's in, please.
It is a college in the centre of town. There is no entrance fee. May I help you with anything else?
