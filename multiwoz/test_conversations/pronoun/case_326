It might. Can you please tell me the entrance fee, address, and phone number of All Saints Church?
Address is jesus lane,entry fee is free,and the phone number is 01223452587.
I also need a train to ely.
There are quite a few. Can you tell me what day and time you'd like to travel so I can narrow it down?
I need to travel Sunday after 11:00 from Cambridge.
I have train TR1159 that departs at 11:50 and will arrive by 12:07. Would that work for you?
Yes, it would. Can you tell me what the travel time is?
The trip will be 17 minutes long.
