I want to visit a theater in the center of town.
There are 4 matches. I don't have any info on the fees. Do you have any other preferences?
No other preferences, I just want to be sure to get the phone number of whichever theatre we pick.
I recommend the cambridge corn exchange there phone number is 01223357851. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes, I am looking for a Tuesday train.
Where will you be departing from and what's your destination?
