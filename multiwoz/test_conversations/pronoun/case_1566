Hi, I'm looking for a guesthouse to stay at that provides free wifi, can you help me find one?
I have several with available booking. May I have an area and a price range that you are interested in?
I am not sure yet but I would like it to have 3 stars.
I'd recommend the Bridge Guest House. It is located in the south area.
That would be great. Can I can the postcode that it is in?
