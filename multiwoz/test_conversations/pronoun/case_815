I travelling to Cambridge and am looking for a train to the London Kings Cross station leaving on Thursday.
Where will you be traveling from on Thursday?
I want to depart from Cambridge after 19:45 and arrive at london kings cross.
TR0720 departs cambridge at 21:00 on Thursday, heading to london kings cross. How many tickets do you need?
I would like to book 4. Can you tell me the price for each ticket before I book them?
The cost for one ticket is 23.60 pounds.
I would actually like to book 5 people and would like to know the reference number for the tickets and the address of La Tasca restaurant.
Booking was successful, your reference number is D8JELRTU . La tasca is located at 14 -16 Bridge Street. Would you like a reservation?
Yes please. Can I book a table for five people?
I'd be happy to book that for you, what day and time would you like that reservation for?
I would like to book it for 5 people at 15:30 on the same day as the train, Thursday. Can I also get the reference number for that as well?
The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Your reference number is XN08QJTD .
Thank you very much!
Is there anything else I can help you with today, or are you all set?
That's all, thank you.
Thank you for using our system!
