Can you give me information about museums in the centre of town?
I found 11 museums in the centre. What would you like to know?
Which is your favorite, and how much is the entrance fee?
I enjoy visiting the whipple museum of the history of science, and best of all it's free to get in. Would you like the address?
No that isn't necessary. Could you help me find a train going to cambridge?
We have any trains going to Cambridge. Where will you be departing from? What day would you like?
I need a train from Leicester to Cambridge on Sunday arriving by 20:00.
There are 14 trains, TR9320 will get you there at 19:54 would that work?
I think that will work. Before I book a ticket, though, could you give me the travel time?
Yes the total travel time would be 105 minutes.
I have everything I need, can I book?
I will be happy to assist you in booking for this train. How many tickets will you be needing?
We need 4 please. We have 2 children under 12. Do they get a special rate?
Unfortunately, I do not have that information. However, I was able to successfully book your train. The total is 120.96 GBP payable at the station. Here is your reference number: FMYXQV28 .
