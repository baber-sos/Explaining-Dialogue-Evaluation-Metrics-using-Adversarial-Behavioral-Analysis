I am planning a trip in Cambridge.
What part of your trip may I be of assistance with?
I am looking for a hotel that includes free wifi.
I have several options available. Do you prefer a cheap, moderate or expensive price range?
I prefer the hotel has at least a two star rating.
The Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge in the north are both moderately priced, two star hotels. There is also a more expensive option in the east. All have internet.
Which of those have free parking?
Both the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge have free parking.
Thank you. I believe I'll try the Lovell. Could you give me their phone number, please?
Certainly. That phone number is 01223425478.
Thanks very much. Can you also help me find a train? I'd like to travel from london liverpool street to cambridge on Thursday and I'd like to get there by 08:45.
There are two trains within that time frame. The train that will get you to Cambridge closest to 08:45 is the TR3839, which leaves at 5:39 and arrives by 07:07.
Could you book 2 tickets on that train please? Also, what is the reference number?
