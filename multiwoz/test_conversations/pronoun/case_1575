I want a restaurant in the city centre that serves Italian food.
There are nine listings available. What price range were you interested in?
I am interested in a restaurant that is in the expensive price range.
Clowns Cafe is a restaurant in the city centre with that price range. Would you like to make a reservation?
Sure! How close is the Cafe from my current location?
