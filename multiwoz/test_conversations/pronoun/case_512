Hello, I am looking for information on a train.
I can help you with that. Where are you headed?
I'm headed to Cambridge from the Stansted Airport. Can you find information for Thursday please?
I found 19 trains what time do you want to leave the airport?
I need to arrive in Cambridge by 14:45 so I will need to leave in time to get there by then.
There is a train that leaves at 5:24.
That won't work, I need to arrive in Cambridge by 14:45 (2:45pm).
Since that won't work for you, I can get you on a train that leaves at 13:24 and will arrive by 13:52. Would you like me to book your seat?
That would be just fine. I just need the Train ID for now. I also need a place to stay.
Yes, that train ID is: TR3637. Can I assist with a booking?
No, I don't need to book it now. Can you help me find an expensive guest house with free parking and wifi?
