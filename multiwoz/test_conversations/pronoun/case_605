Okay, not problem. Would you like to travel by train or taxi? Where are you departing from?
Train, Monday, to Broxbourne from Cambridge.

I need to leave Cambridge after 21:15
There are two trains you can take on Monday, either the 22:01 (arrive 23:01) or the 23:01 (arrive 24:01). Which train do you prefer?
Thank you that will work fine for me and my husband

Yes that would be great, and it'll just be me. Could you also find me a place to stay?
The booking was successful your reference number is UNUTWNQN and the total is 17.89 GBA. I can is do you have a price range and what area?
I'd like to stay in an expensive three star place with free parking. Is there anything like that?
I have 2 options - I would like to suggest the gonville hotel at gonville place. Is there anything else I could help you with?
The Gonville Hotel sounds ok can you provide the the telephone number and do they have internet?
The Gonville does offer both free parking and free internet. You can reach them at 01223366611. Is there anything else I can help with?
