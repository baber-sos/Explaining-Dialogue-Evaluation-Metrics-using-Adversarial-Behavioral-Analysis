I'm looking for a place to dine in the centre that serves jamaican food.
I'm sorry, I'm not finding any place that serves Jamaican food in the centre of town. Would you like to try another area?
That is fine, how about a place that serves Indian food?
There are several of those. Do you have a price range you are looking for?
