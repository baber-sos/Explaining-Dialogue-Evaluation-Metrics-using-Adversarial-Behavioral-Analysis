Can you help me find a train for Sunday. I would like to visit London Kings Street.
There are several leaving for London Kings Cross. They all take 51 minutes and cost 18.88 pounds. Do you have a time of departure in mind?
I want to leave from Peterborough and arrive at Cambridge by 11:45.
There is a train that departs from Peterborough at 10:48, arriving in Cambridge at 11:38. Would that work for you?
Yes, can you please book 7 tickets for me on that train?
With pleasure! It will be train number TR1759. !3.20 pounds per person.
May I have the reference number please?
I was able to get you 7 tickets. Your reference number is 69UPRBA2 . Total is 92.4 GBP payable at the station when you get there.
What is the address and post code of the departing station?
I'm sorry, our system does not have that information. Is there anything else i can help you with?
Yes, I'm looking for something to do in the centre of town that is architecture oriented
Great Saint Mary's Church, Holy Trinity Church, Little Saint Mary's Church, All Saint's Church, and Old Schools are in the center of the city and beautiful architectures.
How about the Holy Trinity Church. What is the entrance fee?
The entrance fee is free.
May I have their address and postcode, too?
