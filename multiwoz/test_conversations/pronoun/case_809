Could really use some grub.
Sure. Is there any part of town that you'd like to look for food in?
Somewhere in the centre. I'm looking for some traditional food.
I'm sorry, but there aren't any traditional restaurants in the centre. Would you like to try another cuisine?
Ok, how about lebanese food?
Ali Baba is a great restaurant that fits exactly what you are looking for. Would you like me to book a table for you?
Yes, please book me a table for 2 people at 12:00 on wednesday.
I'm sorry, that isn't available. Is there another day or time you could eat?
