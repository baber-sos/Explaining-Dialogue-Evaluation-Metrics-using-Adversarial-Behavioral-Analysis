I am looking for a 3 star hotel in Cambridge with free wifi
There are five hotels that meet that criteria. Do you have a location or price range in mind?
I would like something cheap.
Unfortunately, none of the cheap hotels have free wifi. Would you prefer to try a different price range or go with a hotel without free wifi?
