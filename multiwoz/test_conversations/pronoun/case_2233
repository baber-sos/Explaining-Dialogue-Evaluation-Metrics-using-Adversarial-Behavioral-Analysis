Can you help me find a college to visit?
We have 18 colleges. Is there a certain area you would like to visit?
Not really, what do you suggest? Can I have the address, postcode, and entrance fee?
Sue i suggest Christ's College that is in the center, has a postcode of cb23bu, an address of saint andrew's street and the entrance is free of cost.
Thank you. can you also find me a mediterranean restaurant?
what is our price range?
Price is no object, you usually only get to place like cambridge once in your life. I will go with what you recommend, I just need their address.
I would recommend la mimosa at Thompsons Lane Fen Ditton. Would you like me to book it for you?
