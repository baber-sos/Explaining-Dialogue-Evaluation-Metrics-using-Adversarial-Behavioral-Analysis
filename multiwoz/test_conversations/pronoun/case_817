I would like to find a hotel that has free wifi.
Do you have a area of town or price range your interested in?
I do not have a specific area or price.
The arbury lodge guesthouse is one of 32 options for you.
Will it fit 8 people?
Yes, all of the hotels and guesthouses are able to accommodate 8 guests per booking. Are you ready to book? If so, I just need a little more info.
i want to book it for 8 people and 5 nights starting from wednesday.
I have made those reservations and your reference number is RUXDBYB8 .
I am also looking for a place to dine.
Is there an area or cuisine you prefer?
I want a Chinese restaurant in the south
There are 3 restaurants that fall into those categories. One is cheap and 2 are expensive - which do you prefer?
Tell me the postcode for the cheap restaurant
The restaurant is called The Lucky Star. The post code is cb17dy. May I help with anything else?
Okay thanks, thats all i need.
