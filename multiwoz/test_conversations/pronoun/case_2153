Okay, not problem. Would you like to travel by train or taxi? Where are you departing from?
Train, Monday, to Broxbourne from Cambridge.

I need to leave Cambridge after 21:15
There are two trains you can take on Monday, either the 22:01 (arrive 23:01) or the 23:01 (arrive 24:01). Which train do you prefer?
Thank you that will work fine for me and my husband
Would you like me to book the 22:01?
Yes that would be great, and it'll just be me. Could you also find me a place to stay?
The booking was successful your reference number is UNUTWNQN and the total is 17.89 GBA. I can is do you have a price range and what area?
I'd like to stay in an expensive three star place with free parking. Is there anything like that?
