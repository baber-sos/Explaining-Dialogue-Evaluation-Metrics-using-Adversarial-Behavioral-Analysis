No, I have no preference, which one do you recommend?
The cambridge arts theatre is a good choice.
that sounds good. What area is it in?
It is in the centre at 6 Saint Edward's Passage.
I also need the postcode, if you will.
Sure, the postcode is cb23pj. What else can I do for you today?
I need a train as well.
I can help you with that, where will you be traveling from and to, and what day and time would you like to travel?
I will be leaving from Leicester going to Cambridge on Saturday.
There are a lot of choices on that day. Is there a particular time you are looking for?
I would like it to arrive by 10:15 please
I have four trains for you, depending on how early you want to leave. Do you have a depart time?
