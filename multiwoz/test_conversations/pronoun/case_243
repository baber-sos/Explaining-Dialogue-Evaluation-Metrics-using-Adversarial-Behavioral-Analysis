I need a place to stay in the east.
Of course! We have multiple places to choose from. There is one hotel and the rest are guest houses. What kind of price range are you looking at?
It should be an expensive 2 star hotel.
I can recommend Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge. Would you like to book it?
Yes, please. It will be for myself and I'll need it for 5 nights starting on Monday. I will also need the reference number when you have it.
Excellent. Your Booking was successful. Reference number is : CXCS0GLB . Do you need anything else?
I'm also looking for a restaurant. The restaurant should serve chinese food and should be in the same price range as the hotel.
i got 9 in my data base. is there a specific area you prefer?
