I am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should be in the expensive price range and should be in the type of guesthouse
I don't have a guesthouse type of hotel, but I could suggest the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel
its ok if it has free parking
It does have free parking. Would you like me to book it for you?
Are there any guesthouses in the cheap price range?
There are nine cheap guesthouses, all in different areas. Any preference?
can you please tell me about the star of the hotel
