Hi there, I'm looking for a place to eat that serves Indian food in the city centre. Do you have any good recommendations?
There are a total of 9 different Indian restaurants in the centre of town. Is there a particular price you are looking for?
No particular price range, but I do need a restaurant that is available to book 7 people on Friday at 19:15. I also need a reference number.
I have your reservation at the Curry Garden. It is an expensive restaurant on the centre. Your reference number is 24R72HY2 . Do you need their address?
No thank you. I do need to book a train departing from Cambridge though.
I'm going to need a bit more information first. On what day would you like to leave, and what will your destination be?
I would like to leave on Saturday and go to Ely.
What time would you like to depart?
