Hi there. I'd like to find a place to dine in the city centre, preferable with Sri Lankan food. Do you have any recommendations?
Sorry, I don't have any restaurants with sri lankan food in the centre. Would you like to try another type of food?
Could you try again? Moderately priced, perhaps?
Sorry, there was nothing found. Do you want to try a different kind of food?
How about modern european food?
There are two options for modern european food in centre in the moderate price range. May I suggest Riverside Brasserie?
Sure! Could you tell me the address - including the postcode and phone number please?
Sure, they're located at the Doubletree by Hilton Cambridge Granta Place Mill Lane in postcode cb21rt. Their phone number is 01223259988. Can I help with anything else today?
Great. I am also looking for a guesthouse to stay in and I don't need parking.
Not a problem. Do you have a preference on area?
Moderately priced in the centre, please.
Unfortunately, there is no hotel in the moderately priced area
Is there any other type of hotel in the area?
Sorry, there are no guesthouse in centre within the moderate price range. Can I help you with anything else?
I understand that there are no guesthouses in the area. But can you see if there are other hotels in the area? Moderately priced and in the centre, please.
I was able to find cityroomz, it's a hotel in the centre that is moderately priced. Can I make a booking for you?
I just need the postcode, telephone number and address of the hotel please.
The address is sleeperz hotel, station road, postcode cb12tz and phone 01223304050. Is there anything else I can do for you?
I'd like to book a taxi at 16:15 from Riverside Brasserie to Sleeperz Hotel. I'll also need the contact number and car type for that.
What time will you be wanting to be picked up?
I need the taxi at 16:15 leaving the restaurant
Great! It will be a blue ford. Should you need to contact them their number is 07656227446. Can I help you with anything else?
