Please find a moderate price range Turkish restaurant.
Sure, there are two in the centre of town. I prefer Anatolia, located at 30 Bridge Street, City Centre.
I want to book a table for 3 people at 13:00 on wednesday will you do that ?
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes.Reference number is : QPFY6N4G .
Thanks for the booking. I would like to sightsee a bit. Do you have any boat attractions in town?
I have 4 boat attractions. 2 are in the centre, with 1 in the north and east. Are you interested in information about one of them in a certain area?
Please pick the one that you think is the best out of them, and then provide me the phone number and address for it
