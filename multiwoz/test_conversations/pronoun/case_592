I'm looking for an expensive restaurant in the center of town.
There are 33 restaurants that meet your needs. Would you like to narrow your search by type of food?
I don't care about food. Surprise me.
Fitzbillies restaurant serves British food, it's located at 51 Trumpington Street City Centre. Would you like to hear about any others? There are 33 results if British food isn't your style.
That sounds fine. Can you book it please and get me the reference number?
Sure, what day and time would you like and how many people?
I would like a table for 5 at 11:30 on Tuesday, and I will need the reference number. Thanks.
Okay, the booking was successful. The reference number is MQR72WDP . Is there anything else I can help you with?
