Can you help me find a train? I'll be traveling on Wednesday.
What is your departure point and what time would you like to depart?
Oh, of course. Sorry. I'm leaving out of Leicester and going into Cambridge.
Is there a specific time you want to leave or arrive by? I have 2,828 trains to pick from. I need to narrow this down.
I want to arrive by 16:15.
That narrowed it down to 10 options. What time would like to leave?
I don't have a preference on leaving time.
How many tickets?
I need one. Departure time, travel time and train ID? Also, I need a college in the west. I need the phone number and postcode to it.
Let's get the train booked first. Train TR1903 departs Leicester at 05:09 and arrives in Cambridge at 06:54. Shall I book this for you?
No that information is enough for now but I would like to find a college to visit on the west side and would appreciate their telephone and postcode.
I have several options would you like the info?
Yes please give me the information on the top search.
The top search is churchill college it is on the west side phone number is 01223336233 and post code is cb30ds do you need anything else?
