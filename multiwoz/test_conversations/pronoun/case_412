I need a train that leaves on wednesday after 12:30.
I'm happy to help! Could you let me know where you would like to depart from and what your destination is?
I am departing from birmingham new street and my destination is cambridge.
I have 12 trains that leave after 12:30 that day. Did you want to leave at about 13:40? That train arrives at 16:23 and costs 75.10 pounds a ticket.
Yes, thank you.
All set! Your reference number is 9P2D9ORJ .
I am also looking for a certain hotel in the area. It is called the Lovell Lodge. Do you have information on that?
Yes, I do. What would you like to know?
Could you see if they have rooms available for 7 people, for a 4 night stay?
When would you like to begin your stay?
I'd like you begin my stay on Wednesday.
Unfortunately, it doesn't look like there is availability for 7 people, for 4 nights, starting on Wednesday. Would you like to try another day or a shorter stay?
Ummm, I can swing just 2 nights if that is available.
Ok, we were able to book that for you, your confirmation code is 1HC1U1TN .
Thanks, that is all. Goodbye!
You're welcome. Enjoy your trip.
