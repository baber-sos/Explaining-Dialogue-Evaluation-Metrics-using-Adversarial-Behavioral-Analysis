I would like to find in Cambridge, a restaurant, located in the Centre area. I love spanish food.
I have La Tasca downtown here at 14 - 16 Bridge street.
The restaurant should be in the expensive price range
I do not have any in the centre, another criteria perhaps?
How about african food?
I was able to find bedouin, would you like to try that?
