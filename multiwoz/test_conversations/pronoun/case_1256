I'm looking for a museum in the east to visit.
We have four museums in the east area, I just went to the saint barnabas press gallery and they have new exhibits. Would you like more information on them?
Sounds wonderful! Can you give me their postcode?
Their postcode is cb13ew. Can I help you with anything else today?
I'm also looking for a restaurant in the east part of town in the moderate price range.
There are 2 indian restaurants and one italian. Which would you prefer?
give me the address of the one you recommend
I recommend the rajmahal, they are t 7 Barnwell Road Fen Ditton, postal is cb58rg, can i assist with anything else?
