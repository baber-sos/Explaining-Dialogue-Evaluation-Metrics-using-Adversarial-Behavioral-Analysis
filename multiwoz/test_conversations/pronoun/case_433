Hello, Im looking to book a train from broxbourne to cambridge
What day will you be travelling?
I am leaving on Sunday. I would like to arrive before 20:30.
The latest train that will arrive before 20:30 would be train TR1428. It departs at 18:32 and arrives at 19:32. Would that work for you?
Not right now but can you tell me the travel time for this train?
60 minutes is the travel time
Thank you! I am also looking for a place to stay. I would like a guesthouse that includes free wifi.
I've found 23 guesthouses with wifi. Would you like to further specify your request, for example by price, star rating, or location?
How much is the cheapest place?
I can't tell you specifically how much each place will cost per night, but we have places in cheap, moderate, to expensive price ranges.
Ok, any guesthouse that has free wifi and free parking will be fine. I will need it for 2 nights and 3 people are staying.
What day will you be staying there?
