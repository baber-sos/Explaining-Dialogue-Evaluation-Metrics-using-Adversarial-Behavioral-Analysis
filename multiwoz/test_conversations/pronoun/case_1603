I am looking for a place to go!
I can certainly help you find something. Do you have a type of attraction in mind?
I like looking at the architecture of old buildings. I think it says a lot about how we used to live.
We have a lot of interesting architecture here in Cambridge. Is there a particular area of town you're interested in?
What would you suggest?
Here are a few suggestions from the centre: All Saint's Church and Holy Trinity Church, both are free to visit.
The Holy Trinity Church sounds lovely. Can you give me their postcode, please?
