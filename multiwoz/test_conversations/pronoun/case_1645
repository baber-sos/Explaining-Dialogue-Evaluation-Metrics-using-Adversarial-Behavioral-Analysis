Are there any 4-star hotels which are moderately priced?
We have 11 guest houses which are moderately priced, but no hotels.
A guesthouse is fine. I'm looking for a place in the north with free parking.
Acorn guest house is available if that works for you.
That's good. Can you book it for 3 people?
For how many days and starting what day?
Starting Friday for 4 nights. There will be 3 guests.
I'm not able to book for those nights. Would you want to try a shorter stay?
