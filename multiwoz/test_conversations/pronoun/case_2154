Hello, I need a train to Norwich please. I need to be there by 08:45.
I have many trains available. What is your departure site and day you would like to travel?
I'll be leaving Cambridge on Thursday.
TR2266 will get you to norwich at 7:55. It leaves Cambridge at 6:36. Would you like to book a seat?
is there anything else that arrives closer to 8:45 like I requested?
I'm sorry, that is the closest arrival to 08:45. Would you like me to look at something arriving after that time?
No, TR2266 will work, could you get me tickets for 5 people and a reference number?
You have 5 seats reserved on TR2266, reference #2V0XYT43 . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
I also need a place to stay with 4 stars that include free wifi.
I have found 21 places to stay. Do you have a price range preference?
No but I would like it to be in the north.
