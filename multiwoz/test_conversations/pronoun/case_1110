am looking for a place to dine it should be in the centre and should be in the expensive price range
Were you looking for a specific type of food?
Yes, I am looking for a restaurant that offers vegetarian options.
I'm sorry but I do not have any vegetarian restaurants in the Centre area. Would you like me to search another area for you?
Yes, how about expensive turkish food in the centre of town?
You would probably enjoy meze bar restaurant. Would you like me to make a reservation?
Yes, please reserve a table for 4 on Monday at 15:15.
I'm sorry booking was unsuccessful. Could you try another time perhaps?
Okay, how about the same time for Saturday?
Still not open then, shall I try another date or another place to eat?
Could you try another expensive Turkish restaurant in the centre? I'd really like to dine on Monday.
The meze bar restaurant is expensive and serves turkish food. What time on Monday, and how many in your party?
For 4 people at 15:15 on either Monday or Saturday please.
Sorry, your booking was unsuccessful. Would you like a different day or time slot?
