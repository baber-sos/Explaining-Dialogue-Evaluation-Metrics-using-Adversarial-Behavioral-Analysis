I am looking for a cheap guesthouse to stay in for my trip to Cambridge.
I have 9 entries matching your request. Do you have a preference for area?
Preferably in the west side of town. I would also like something 4-star rated if possible.
There are 7 guesthouses that meet your criteria. Might I recommend alexander bed and breakfast?
Does it have a 4 star rating and internet?
Finches Bed and Breakfast is located in the West. It is an inexpensive four star guesthouse with internet and parking. Would you like me to book a room for you?
That's all the info I needed can you find me a concerthall in the south?
I'm afraid the only concert hall in town is The Man on the Moon, but it's in the centre rather than the south. Would that work for you?
Are there any places listed simply as "entertainment" that are in the south?
We have Nusha and TenPin in the South.
Sounds good, please advise the address and phone number. Thank you.
The address for Nusha is unit g6, cambridge leisure park, clifton road and the phone number is 01223902158. Do you also need TenPin's information?
Oh, the way you said it I thought Nusha and Tenpin was the whole name of the place. But I'm sure Nusha will be plenty entertaining, even without the tenpin.
