Hi there, I'm looking for a restaurant that serves Swedish food. It can be anywhere, I'm willing to pay a moderate amount of money. Do you have any recommendations?
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find anything that matches your request. Shall we look for a cheap or expensive Swedish restaurant instead?
Sure, look for a cheap restaurant. And I prefer the west if possible.
Unfortunately there are none fitting that criteria either, would you like me to search for a different type of restaurant?
A British restaurant, please.
