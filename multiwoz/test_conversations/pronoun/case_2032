Hi, can you give me some information on a place to stay in Cambridge? I would prefer some place expensive.
Sure, there are 5 expensive hotels in Cambridge. Is there an area you prefer?
No specific area, but I would like a guesthouse, rather than a hotel. I would also like a place that's 3 stars.
There are 2 three star hotels would you like me to book one?
No. Are there any three star guesthouses available at a moderate price that include free wifi?
Yes, there are 3: bridge guest house, hamilton lodge, and hobsons house.
How about the bridge guest house for 5 people for 2 nights starting on tuesday?
Booking was successful. The address is 151 hills road. Postcode is cb28rj. The reference number is: 98WBW794 .
Great! I also need a place to dine in the east.
I can help you with that as well! Do you have a specific food preference you are looking for?
I would love some eastern european food, please.
There are no restaurants that serve European food in the area would you like another type of food or another area?
How about italian?
We do have an Italian place. Pizza Hut Fen Ditton. Would you like to book a table?
No, I assume it is moderately priced though? If so, I just need an address, postcode and phone number.
It is moderately priced. The phone number is 01223323737. The address and postcode is Cambridge Retail Park Newmarket Road Fen Ditton cb58wr.
Great, I would also need a taxi to commute from Pizza Hut to the hotel.
Certainly. What time would you like the taxi to meet you at the restaurant?
