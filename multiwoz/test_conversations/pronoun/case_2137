I am looking for information. Can you help me find a place to stay? I want a hotel, not a guestroom.
What area and/or price range would you like? If neither of those matter, I recommend the Gonville, in the center of town.
Moderate would be a perfect price range.
Do you have any other criteria?
Yes, a 2 star rating would be great.
we have two at the note, do i recommend one?
Yes please do and book it for 5 people for 4 nights from Monday.
Ashley Hotel is a great hotel located in the north with free wifi and parking. If that sounds good to you, then I will go ahead and book it?
Yes please.
great! for how many people, which day, and for how long?
5 people for 4 nights starting from monday.
You are booked for the Ashley Hotel. Your reference number is FX8L2KID . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
I also need to book a taxi to commute between the two places.
Okay, where are you departing from?
Actually I am looking for the Corn Cambridge Exchange first.
The Cambridge Corn Exchange is a theater in the center of the city. It's located at Wheeler Street, would you like their address?
Yes, and I would also like to book a taxi to leave by 07:15.
what is your destination?
Before we move on to the taxi, can I get the address and phone number for the Cambridge corn exchange? And what area is that in?
the phone number is 01223350059.
thank you for your help
I believe you also asked for the address and area. The address is Wheeler Street and it is in the centre. Is there anything else you needed?
that's all i need thanks
Sorry, just to clarify, did you actually not need a taxi after all then?
Sorry, yes please book a taxi. Departing from the Cambridge corn exchange back to the hotel by 7:15. I will be needing the car type and contact number.
A black Lexus will be waiting for you at 7:15 in front, contact number 07495116373. Can I help with anything else?
