can you help me find some attractions in the east part of town?
Definitely! My favorite place in the east is the Funky Fun House. It's funky and fun!
Can I have the number please?
It's 01223304705. Do you need anything else?
Yeah, I need a restaurant. They need to serve Indian food and be in the same area as Funky Fun House.
There are 4 Indian restaurants in the area. Two are moderately priced and two are expensive. Can I ask what price range you would like?
I would prefer one in the moderate price range.
May I suggest the Rajmahal located at 7 Barnwell Road Fen Ditton

Sure, their phone number is 01223244955 and the postcode is cb58rg. Is there anything else I could help you with?
