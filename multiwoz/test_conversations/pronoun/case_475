I need a place to stay for my trip to cambridge in the east area.
There are 7 great places to choose from. Are you looking for a guesthouse or hotel?
I don't care about the type as long as it is in the east and has free parking.
I'd recommend the Autumn House. Would you like to make a booking?
Yes please. I need the reservation to be for 8 people and 2 nights starting on Tuesday.
Great. I successfully booked your stay. Your reference number is 2OVWNFW1 . Is there anything else I can help you with?
I am looking for a particular attraction. Its name is called lynne strover gallery
The Lynne Strover Gallery is a wonderful museum in the West area of town, it is free to enter. Would you like the phone number and address perhaps?
Yes, I would also like to know what kind of attraction it is and the entrance fee.
It is a museum and it is free entry.
What area is it in?
