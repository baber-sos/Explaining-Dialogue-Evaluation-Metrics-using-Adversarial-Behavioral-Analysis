I'm looking for some architecture in the west
I'm sorry, it appears the only architectural attractions in Cambridge are in the city center. Would you like info on any of them?
Do you have any attractions in the type of a museum then in the west area?
I have 7 in the west area. Would you like information about the kettle's yard or cafe jello gallery maybe?
Yes, can you tell me about the kettle's yard? What is the address and entrance fee?
