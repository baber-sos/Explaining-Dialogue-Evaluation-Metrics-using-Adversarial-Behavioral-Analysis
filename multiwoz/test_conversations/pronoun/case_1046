I am looking for some places to go, do you have any attractions in the east?
I have several places that may interest you on that side of town. What type of place are you looking for?
I really don't have a preference. Can you recommend a few?
Well, we have camboats and the cambridge museum of technology, both of which are interesting places. Would you like information about either of these?
Sure. also could you help me find a restaurant serving unusual food in the same part of town?
There doesn't seem to be any restaurants in that area that serve unusual food. Do you have another food preference?
How about Italian?
Yes I have the Pizza Hut fen Ditton on the east side serving Italian food and it is moderately priced.
Can I get the postcode and phone number please?
Their postcode is cb58wr and phone number is 01223323737
Thank you so much. I think that's all I need.
