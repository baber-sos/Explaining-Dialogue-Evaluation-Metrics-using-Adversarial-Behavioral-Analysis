i am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should include free wifi and should include free parking.
What about acorn house? It seems lovely
I need something cheap and in the centre of town.
In that case, you have two selections. The Alexander Bed and Breakfast is one. The other is El Shaddai. Were you looking for a particular star rating?
Could you book me a room at The Alexander Bed and Breakfast for 6 people and 2 nights starting from friday?
Yes, I just did. Would you like their phone number?
