What train do I take to get to Birmingham New Street? I need to leave after 17:00.
There are trains departing hourly at 1 minute past the hour from 17:01 until 23:01. All are 75.10 pounds, and take 163 minutes.
I am looking to travel on Monday. The first train at 17:01 would be fine. Can I get that train info?
Sure the trainID is TR7728. It leaves at 17:01 and arrives at 19:44. Would you like to make a reservation?
Yes please make a reservation and give me the reference number.
Your reservation is book. The reference number is LMB9KCHM . Can I assist you with anything else today?
I'm also looking for an expensive restaurant in the south.
There are 5 restaurants that fit your description. What type of food are you looking for?
