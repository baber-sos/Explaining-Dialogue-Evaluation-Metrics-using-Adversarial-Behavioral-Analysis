I need a place to dine in the centre of town, serving eritrean food.
I cannot find an eritrean restaurant in that area, would you like me to look up another area or cuisine type?
Can you check another area?
There are none in town. Is there another type of food you would like?
Sure, how about British? Moderate prices in the centre is necessary.
Restaurant one seven is located on DeVere University Arms Regent Street City Centre.
I need a table for 6 on Tuesday. At 13:30.
I have booked it Reference number is : WZ2PQDLR . Can I help you with anything else?
