I'm looking for a place to stay on the north side.
Alright, there are 13 guesthouses and hotels on the north side. You have a price range in mind, or is there a particular amenity you need?
I'm looking for one with 0 stars, please.
City Centre North B and B is just what you're looking for. It's a guesthouse with free wifi and parking at 328a histon road cb43ht. Would you like to book?
