I am looking for a play to stay that has 4 stars and is located in the centre of town.
We have two results. Are there any other options like free parking you need?
Yes. It should be a 4 star and of moderate price. Parking and wifi do not matter.
Unfortunately there are no hotels that match your criteria. Do want to consider other areas of town or a different price range?
Okay how about and expensive one instead?
I'm sorry, I don't see any 4- or 5-star hotels with availability in the centre. Would you like to look for a 3-star hotel, or another area?
There are no expensive hotels in the centre area with a star rating of 4? Can you double-check?
