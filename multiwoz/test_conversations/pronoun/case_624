Hi, can you give me some information on places to stay on my trip?
I can we have 33 places to stay, do you have any pricerange or area you'd like to stay?
I'd like one in the expensive price range that includes free wifi.
The University Arms Hotel is very nice and includes free parking as well as wifi. Does that sound good?
Sounds good, could you book me a room for three people for three nights starting Thursday?
I have made a booking here is the information-Booking was successful. Reference number is : VPNP1BF0 .
Great, thank you. I'm also looking for a college to visit in the centre, do you have any recommendations?
Certainly. There are 13 located in the centre. Are you wanting one that has free admission?
Yes, free admission would be nice.
Christ's College is in the centre and has free entrance fee.
Thank you. Can you tell me their post code please?
The post code for Christ's College is cb23bu.
Awesome, thanks for your help! I'm finished now, bye!
