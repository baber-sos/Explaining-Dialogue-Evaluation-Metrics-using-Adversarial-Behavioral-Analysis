Konnichiwa, I am coming to town and will be staying a few days. I need a place in town centre that offers free parking. Can you help me?
I certainly can. I have 4 different options for you. I have two cheap gueshouses and two expensive hotels. Do you have a preference?
I will take one of the cheap guesthouses please?
How about the Alexander bed and breakfast, I can book it for you now if you like?
That sounds great. I'd like to book it for 2 people. We'll be arriving Tuesday and we'd like to stay for 5 nights please.
