Can you help me book a reservation at the Warkworth House hotel?
Yes I could! How many people are staying, and what days would you like to stay?
It's just for me, and I'll be staying for three nights starting from Tuesday.
I apologize, but there are no vacancies to accommodate a 3 day stay beginning Wednesday. Would you like to book another day or shorter stay?
I wanted to begin my stay on Tuesday, not Wednesday. Could you check for Tuesday?
I'm sorry but i'm unable to make the reservation on tuesday.
Three nights beginning on Tuesday just for myself. I'd like the reference number as well.
I apologize but the booking was not successful for three days starting tuesday. Would you be willing to book a shorter stay?
I'd like those 3 days on Tuesday for 1.
Unfortunately that booking was unsuccessful . May we try for a shorter stay or a different day?
How about 2 nights?
That was accepted. Your reference number is 7HVR4RK2 . And that was for 2 nights, 1 person. Anything else?
I would like to visit an attraction in the centre area please.
There are over 40 to choose from, do you have any particular activity in mind?
