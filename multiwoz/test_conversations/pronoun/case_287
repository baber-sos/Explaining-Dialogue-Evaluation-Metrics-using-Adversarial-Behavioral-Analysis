I'm looking for a train to Stevenage that leaves after 17:30. Is there anything available then?
I have a few choices for you. What day are you wanting to travel?
I would like to leave on Thursday out of Cambridge.
The TR0385 leaves at 19:21, would that suit you?
Yes, that sounds perfect. I would like a booking for 4 people.
The booking was successful. Your reference number is SICMOAA9 . Can I help you with anything else?
