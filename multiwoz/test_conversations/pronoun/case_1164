Can you help me find a moderately priced place to stay?
sure, i have 18 options for you
Thank you! I would like a 4-star hotel, please.
the a and b guest house is located in the east and is a 4 star.
I'd prefer a moderately priced place in the north.
There are 7 guesthouses in the north part of the city that fit your needs. Do you have any other requirements, such as parking or internet?
No not at all. I just need to know if they have internet and what the postcode and phone number is for one of them.
The archway house fits the bill. It's at 52 gilbert road post code cb43pe and it's number is 01223575314
Great I'm also looking for some info on a restaurant called nandos city centre

You're all set. The restaurant can only hold your table for 15 minutes after the reservation time. Your Reference number is : JAAA0FJ8 .
