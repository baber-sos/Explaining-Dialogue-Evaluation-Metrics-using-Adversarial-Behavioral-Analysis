I am coming to cambridge to try some good food, but would like to find a place to go in the centre area.
There are many good restaurants in the centre. Did you have a type of cuisine in mind?
I would like to go to an attraction first in the center of town. Are there any museums?
There are 11 museums in the centre. Would you like me to recommend one?
