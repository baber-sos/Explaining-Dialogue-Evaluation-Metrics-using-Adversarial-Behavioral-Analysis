I am looking for a dining place that serves Indian food.
There are many Indian restaurants. What price range do you prefer?
Expensive would be great.
I found 14 that would meet your needs. What about curry garden? It is located at 106 Regent Street City Centre
That sounds great. Please make me a reservation for 6 at 13:15 on Friday
How many people?
