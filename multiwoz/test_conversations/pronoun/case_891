I'm looking for a train ticket, do you book those?
Yes, where will you be leaving from and going to?
I'm leaving from Cambridge and going to bishops stortford.
On what day will you be traveling? Do you prefer a specific time as well?
I need to book a train going to bishops stortford from Cambridge. It needs to arrive by 14:15 on saturday. I need 8 tickets. Can I please get a reference number.
Absolutely! You are booked for 8 seats on TR5643 leaving at 13:29 and arriving at 14:07. The cost is 64.64 GBP due at the station. Reference: Y6865OET
Thank you! I'm also looking for a hotel with free parking and internet. Can you find one?
Yes I have many options. What side of town did you want to stay on and what price range are you looking for.
The area doesn't matter, I'd like to stay at a guesthouse though.
I recommend the Archway House. It's a lovely place on the north side of town. Would you like me to book a room for you?
Just a couple more questions. What is the star rating? Also, I need to know the area of town and the phone number please.
Archway house has a 4 star rating and is located in the north area of town. The phone is 01223575314, shall I book you a room?
No, I just need the information for now. Thanks!
Do you have everything you need?
Yes, thank you for all your help today. Goodbye.
My pleasure! Please call us back if you need anything else.
