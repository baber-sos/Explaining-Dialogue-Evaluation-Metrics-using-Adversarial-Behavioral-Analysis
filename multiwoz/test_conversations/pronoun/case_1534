I am looking for a train headed to london liverpool street.
I can help! What day are you traveling?
On tuesday - the train needs to arrive by 14:45 too.
Five trains match your request. The first train leaves at 05:59. Do you want a seat on this train or do you want to see additional departure times?
Yes, I do want a seat on the train. Please give me the train's ID.
That would be train TR7299. Would you like me to book you passage?
Not right now, thanks. I am also looking for some places to go in the west area of town. What attractions do they offer there?
