I'm looking for a train. The train should go to birmingham new street and should depart from cambridge.
Is this for a specific day?
Yes, the train should arrive by 21:30 and should depart on Sunday.
There are 14 trains that meet your criteria, beginning at 05:01. Is there a preference on when you would like to depart cambridge?
The one that arrives the closest to 21:30, please. I will need the price and the train ID.
TR2631 leaves Cambridge at 17:01 and arrives in Birmingham at 19:44. The price is 60.08 pounds.
Thank you. I am also looking for a place to stay that is in the north side of town.
I can certainly help you with that. There are many accommodations on the north side of town. Do you have any preferences?
I would prefer a place with a star of 4 that includes free parking and free wifi.
There are 7 different hotels that fit that, 6 are moderately priced and one falls into the cheap price range. Would you like more information?
Yes, please. I need a price range and phone number.
The price range is moderate for 6 of the hotels, and cheap for one hotel. Do you know which hotel you would like the number to?
I would like a moderate hotel with free wifi and parking.
There are 7 hotels meeting those criteria. Do you want me to choose for you?
Yes, choose for me! That sounds exciting! Try something new! Just decide and then give me the hotel-type, price range, and phone number! This is so cool!
Would you like to stay at the Arbury Lodge Guesthouse? If so, would you like me to book it for you? The address is 82 Arbury Road, it is a moderate priced hotel and the phone number is 01223364319.
