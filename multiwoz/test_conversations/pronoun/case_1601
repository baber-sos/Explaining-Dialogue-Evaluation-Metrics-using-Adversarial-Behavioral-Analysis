Are there any trains on Wednesday that travel from Norwich to Cambridge?
There are several trains traveling from Norwich to Cambridge on Wednesday. Is there any particular time you are looking for? The earliest is 5:16.
The train should arrive by 14:30 please.
The TR118 arrives at 10:35. Does that work for you?
I think that will work. What is the departure time of that train?
That train leaves at 9:16. Would you care to book passage?
Yes please, can I get my train ID? I'm also want to look for a restaurant that serves Corsica with a moderate price range.
Your train ID is TR1180. Am I correct that you will only be needing one ticket?
