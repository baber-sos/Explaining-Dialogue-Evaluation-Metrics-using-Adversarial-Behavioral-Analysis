Hi! Can you help me find some places to go on the south side of the city? I'm super bored!
I am happy to help. There are several types of places to go in the South. Parks, theatre, cinema, museum, nightclub. What sounds good to you?
I don't have a preference. Could you make a recommendation?
How about a nightclub or cinema? There's also a great museum.
Anything is fine whatever is most popular.
Sure, Cineworld Cinema will be great. What information do you need about this attraction?
Can I get the address, entrance fee and attraction type please?
The address is cambridge leisure park, clifton way. It is a cinema. I do not know the entrance fee, unfortunately.
I am also wanting some information on a hotel called the Kirkwood House. Can you tell me about them?
