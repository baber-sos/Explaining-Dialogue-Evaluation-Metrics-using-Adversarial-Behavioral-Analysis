Good Evening, I am looking for a place to stay that includes free parking
Okay, I have 29 options for you. Is there an area of town that you'd prefer to stay in?
I'm not sure. I would prefer something moderately priced.
That narrows it down a bit. The Acorn Guest House is a nice place, with 4 stars. It's in the north area of town.
Sounds good, I changed my mind about the internet, can you let me know if it has free wifi?
