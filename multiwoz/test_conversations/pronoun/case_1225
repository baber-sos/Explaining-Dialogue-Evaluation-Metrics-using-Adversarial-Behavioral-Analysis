Can you let me know about 4 star places in cambridge? I want a personal touch, so a guesthouse who be perfect.
There are several 4 star guesthouses to choose from. What price range would you prefer?
Moderately priced will work. Also it should include free parking.
How does the acorn guest house sound? It is in the north.
Sounds good, could you book me a room for 1 person for 4 nights starting Saturday?
