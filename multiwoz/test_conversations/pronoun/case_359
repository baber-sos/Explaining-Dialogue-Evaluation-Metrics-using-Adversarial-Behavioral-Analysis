I'm looking for a place to eat. Something moderately priced, in the center.
Yes, there are lots of options for you. What type of food are you looking for?
I don't really have a type of cuisine in mind. Maybe you could recommend someplace moderately priced and in the centre of town?
I can recommend the yippee noodle bar it is asian oriental. Does that sound ok?
Sounds great, can you book it or 2 people at 15:30 om Monday?
