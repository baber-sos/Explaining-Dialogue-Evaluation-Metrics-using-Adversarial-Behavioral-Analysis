Find me a museum, please.
There are 23 museums. Do you have an area as a preference?
I just need the area and address for one of them.
I have the broughton house gallery in the centre at 98 king street
Thank you so much. I also need a place to dine in the centre that serves Chinese food.
I have 10 place in the centre. Did you have a price range you were looking at?
I would like the cheap price range.
I recommend the rice house. Would you like me to reserve a table?
Yes, please book me a table for 8 on Monday at 19:30.
Unfortunately, I could not book the rice house for that day and time. Is there another day or time that would work for you?
Can you try a half hour earlier or later and see if they have anything available?
No luck, would you like me to try something else?
