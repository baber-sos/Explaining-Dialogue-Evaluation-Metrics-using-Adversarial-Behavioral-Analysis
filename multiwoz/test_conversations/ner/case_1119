Can you give me information about museums in the centre of town?
I found 11 museums in the centre. What would you like to know?
Which is your favorite, and how much is the entrance fee?
I enjoy visiting the whipple museum of the history of science, and best of all it's free to get in. Would you like the address?
No that isn't necessary. Could you help me find a train going to cambridge?
