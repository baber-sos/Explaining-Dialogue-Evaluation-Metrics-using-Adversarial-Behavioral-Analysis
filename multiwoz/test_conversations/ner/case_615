I'm looking for a train departing from cambridge on wednesday.
Okay. What is your destination?
I am attending a seminar in Ely.
There are 10 trains on that route starting at 05:50. To make sure I book the right one what time do you need to arrive?
Well, I just want to leave after 9:15.
Alright, there are 8 options. The earliest train after 09:15 leaves at 09:50 and the latest at 23:50, each takes 17 minutes. Do you have a preference?
The 9:50 train will be fine. I'll need to book for 6 people. Can I please have the reference number?
Your tickets have been booked. Your total is 26.4 GBP and will be payable at the station. Your confirmation is 04Q2G0GU .
Great I also need a moderate priced place to stay with free wifi.
That gives us about 17 options. Is there a certain area in the city you prefer to stay in?
I definitely need it to include free parking.
What area of town do you prefer?
I don't have an area I prefer, can you recommend something?
I recommend archway house. It's a guesthouse moderately priced located on the north side. Will that work for you?
Yes, that should work. Can you book it for me?
Sure. How many guests and how many nights?
It will be the same group of people that are on the train. I'll need it to start on Sunday and go for 3 nights.
