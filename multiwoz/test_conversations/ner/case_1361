Yes, I'd like to find a cheap hotel in Cambridge for Monday.
I found the Cambridge Belfry hotel located in the west and in the cheap price range. Would you like me to book this for you?
On second thought, I'd like a moderately priced guest house.
There are 15 choices. Can I recommend acorn guest house in the north? If so, would you like to make a reservation?
I need wifi, and free parking, if possible.
The Acorn offers both.
That sounds great. Can you book it for Wednesday for 5 nights?
Sure, how many people will be staying, and did you want the booking for Wednesday, or Monday?
I need it starting on Wednesday for 6 people.
