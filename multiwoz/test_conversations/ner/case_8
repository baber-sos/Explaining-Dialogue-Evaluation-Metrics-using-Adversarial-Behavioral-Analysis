Thank you so much for your help.
Do you need help booking a ticket on that train or with anything else?
I want to make a booking for 7 people, and I need the reference number. Also, I need to book an expensive guesthouse.
The fee for the train tickets is 125.29 GPB which is payable at the station. Your reference number is 42CZLF04 . Is there a specific guest house you have in mind?
I don't have a specific one in mind. I would like something expensive though.
I don't have any expensive guesthouses listed. Would you like to try a different price range or a hotel instead/
Sure, how about one in the moderate price range.
Okay great! We have many that match your request, do you have a specific area you'd like?
The guesthouse should be in the east, please.
There are three guesthouses in that area, 2 have free parking and internet, would you like more information on them?
Yes, show them.
The three options are a and b guesthouse( no parking), carolina bed and breakfast and warkworth house. Any preferences?
Can you let me know the postcode, if they have free parking, and phone number for carolina bed and breakfast?
They all have 4 stars. Warkworth House has internet and parking. Their number is 01223363682 and postcode is cb11ee. Does this work for you?
