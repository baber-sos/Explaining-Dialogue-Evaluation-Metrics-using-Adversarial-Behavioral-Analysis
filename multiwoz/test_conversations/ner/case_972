I'm currently planning my trip to Cambridge, but need some help finding a certain restaurant.
Sure, I can help you with that. What type of cuisine are you looking for?
Actually, I'm looking for some info on Kymmoy restaurant. Can you tell me about them?
Absolutely! They are a great asian oriental restaurant in the centre of town. They are on the expensive side. Would you like help in reserving a table?
I need their address, and postcode.
They are at 52 Mill Road City Centre, postcode cb12as
Thanks. Can you also help me find a train to Bishops Stortford?
There are more than 70 trains to bishops Stratford, could you tell me what day you would like to leave, where you would like to leave from, and the times.
I am leaving cambridge on sunday, can you please tell me the travel time on that ride?
Sure, it is a 38 minute trip. Would you like a ticket?
I need to leave after 14:45 also.
The TR3600 departs Cambridge at 15:29, would that suit you?
