i need a place to stay
Is there a certain area or price range you had in mind?
I really want to stay with something moderately priced. But, I want it to be 4 star rated if possible.
There are lots of moderately priced four star hotels. Are you interested in a particular part of town?
Maybe a guesthouse with free parking, I have 7 guests and that will be for 2 nights this Monday
We have several such choices in the north, south and east. If you have no preference for location shall I just book one for you?
That would be great.
Carolina bed and breakfast is a moderate price, 4 star guesthouse in the east area with wifi and parking. Will that work?
Yeah, that sounds great. Do they have room for all 7 of us?
I can try to see if we do. Can you provide when you want to stay and for how long?
book it for 7 people and 2 nights starting from monday.
