I am looking for a Europeon restaurant in the west of Cambridge.
Ok, I found the Cambridge lodge restaurant. Would you like to make a reservation?
Is that an expensive restaraunt? I really need someplace expensive, it is a special occasion for me.
I'd suggest cambridge lodge restaurant on Cambridge Lodge Hotel 139 Huntingdon Road City Centre, cb30dq. Would you like me to make a reservation?
Yes, please make the reservation for me.
I need to know for what day and time and for how many people please
Make the reservation for 3 people on Friday at 20:00. Thank you!
I've got it booked for you at 20:00 on Friday for 3 people. They'll hold your table for 15 minutes. Your reference number is Y2C9CD1C .
Thanks. Can you also give me some information about Finches Bed and Breakfast? We're thinking of staying there.
Sure thing, it's a 4 star guesthouse on the west side, located at 144 thornton road. Is there anything else you would like to know?
Can I book a room there for 3 for 3 nights starting friday?
