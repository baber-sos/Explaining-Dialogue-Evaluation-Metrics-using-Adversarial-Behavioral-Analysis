I need a train to cambridge and it should depart from birmingham new street.
What day will you be traveling?
Saturday. I need to arrive in Cambridge by 19:00.
There are a number of trains to choose from, do you have a more specific departure time that would be best for you?
As long as I arrive in Cambridge by 19:00 that's all I care about. I don't want to cut it too close, though, in case of a train delay.
