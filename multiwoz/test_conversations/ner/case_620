Hi, can you help me find an architecture based attraction to go to?
There are 5 architecture based attractions in Cambridge. All in the centre of town. Would you prefer a church or a school?
Any church will be fine. Can you give me the phone number of one?
Certainly, All Saints Church's number is 01223452587.
Cool. I need a restaurant called the slug and lettuce too.
Would you like me to make a reservation at The Slug and Lettuce for you?
No thank you. Could you tell me what area of town The Slug and Lettuce is in, though?
