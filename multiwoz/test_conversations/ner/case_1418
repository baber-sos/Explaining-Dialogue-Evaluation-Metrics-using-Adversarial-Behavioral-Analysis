Hi, I'm looking for a hotel to stay in that includes free wifi. I'm looking to stay in a hotel, not a guesthouse.
Yes I have many options. What is your preferred price point?
I would like one in the moderate price range and with free parking.
I would recommend the Lovell Lodge. It is indeed a hotel despite it's name and is very cute.
