Hi, I am looking for some architecture to go to in the centre of town. Any ideas?
i'd like to suggest to you all saints church entrance there is free
Great, can I have the address and postcode?
Of course. The church is on Jesus Lane and the postcode is cb58bs. Can I help you with anything else?
I'm also going to need to catch a train into Cambridge for Sunday.
