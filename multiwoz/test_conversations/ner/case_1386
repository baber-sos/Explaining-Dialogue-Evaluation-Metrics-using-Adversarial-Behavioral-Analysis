Yes, I need a guesthouse with free wifi.
There are 23 guesthouses with free wifi. Would you like to stay in the south near the restaurant?
Yes please, and I'll need free parking as well.
I think allenbell would fit your needs. Want me to book it?
Well how many stars does it have?
My apologies. Allenbell is not in the south. However, I highly recommend the 4 star Aylesbray Lodge located in the south and moderately priced. Can I help you with your booking?
