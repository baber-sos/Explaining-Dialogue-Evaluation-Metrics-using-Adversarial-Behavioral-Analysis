Can you help me find a place to eat? I am looking for a place that serves cheap corsica food.
I'm sorry, we have no cheap corsica eateries. Care to try anything else?
Tell me some restaurant types in the town centre?
There's Chinese, Indian, Italian, Mediterranean, and Spanish, there's a few others if none of those sound appealing.
Could you please find me an italian restaurant in the centre?
Of course! I have three: Pizza Hut City Centre, Ask, and Zizzi Cambridge. Would you like to book one of these?
Yes, can you book a table for 1 at Zizzi Cambridge? I would like to go at 11:15 on tuesday.
