I'm trying to plan a trip there but need a cheap place to stay.
alexander bed and breakfast is located in the centre. They are located at 56 saint barnabas road.
Hmm, I'm looking for a place in the west. It doesn't need to include internet.
finches bed and breakfast is cheap.
okay do they have free wifi?
Yes, they have free wifi and free parking!
Okay. Sounds good. Can you tell me the type of hotel and provide me with the hotel's phone number?
Finches is a guesthouse, and their number is 01223276653. Can I help with anything else today?
You sure can. I'm also quite hungry. Do you have any info on a restaurant called Wagamama?
Yes, Wagamama is a Japanese restaurant on the pricey side. Would you like their phone number or address?
