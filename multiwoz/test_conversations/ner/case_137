I am looking for a cinema in cambridge.
We have two cinemas: Cineworld in the south, and Vue in the center of town.
That's great, thank you for your help!
Would you prefer something in the center of town, or in the South?
Any area is fine. I'm also looking for a restaurant in the centre that serves spanish food.
There are 2 restaurants that fit your criteria. Is there a price range you are looking for?
I would like something that is on the cheaper side.
Sure, la raza is spanish food and is cheap. Would you like to book a table?
