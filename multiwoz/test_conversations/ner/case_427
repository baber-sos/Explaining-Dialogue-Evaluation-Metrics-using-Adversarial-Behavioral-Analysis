Can you help me find a moderate price place to stay that includes free parking?
Acorn guest house has free parking and is moderately priced. Would you like more information?
Does it also have free wifi and does it have 2 stars?
No it doesn't. But the Ashley Hotel has 2 stars and free parking. It is a moderate also.
Is there somewhere with both free wifi and parking?
Yes. The Ashley Hotel has both free wifi and parking. Would you like to make a reservation?
