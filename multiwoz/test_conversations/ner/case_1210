I need help finding an expensive place to eat in the west please.
There are many options for expensive food in West Cambridge. Is there a specific type of food you would like?
Yes, I would like eat Indian food, where I can eat Search Chicken Tikka Masala.
I'm sorry, there is nothing showing for Chicken Tikka Masala. There are however 5 expensive Indian restaurants in the west part of Cambridge. I would recommend the Rice Boat.
