I'm looking for a train to cambridge.
What day will you be traveling?
I would like to leave on Friday.
Okay I have several. What time are you leaving, and how many tickets would you like?
I am leaving Thurtsday at 2pm and need three tickets
I have the TR5502 that leaves at 3:17pm. Would that work for you?
Actually, I never told you where I was leaving from. I need the train to depart from Kings Lynn.
TR2162 leaves at 14:11. Want to book it?
yes please, 7 people. And I'd like the reference number please.
Certainly! The total fare is 68.60 Pounds, payable at the station, and the reference number is QN77ZH17 . Can I help you with anything else?
Yes, I'm also looking for a place to stay in the south. I'd like a guesthouse if possible.
I can recommend the bridge guest house.
That sounds great. PLease book for 7 people for 5 nights starting on friday.
