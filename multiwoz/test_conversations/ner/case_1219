I'm looking for a place to stay. It needs to be a guesthouse and include free wifi.
There are 23 hotels that meet your needs. Would you like to narrow your search by area and/or price range?
I would like for it to be cheap and include free parking.
There are nine guesthouse hotels in various areas. What part of town are you hoping for?
Nothing in particular. I just need it booked for 6 people for a total of 4 nights starting from sunday. I'd also like the reference number, please.
Sure! We will book you in a hotel with 4 stars. The reservation will be for 6 people for 4 nights. How many rooms would you like to reserve?
Well, for six people I suppose I will be needing three rooms, for four nights, starting Sunday.
