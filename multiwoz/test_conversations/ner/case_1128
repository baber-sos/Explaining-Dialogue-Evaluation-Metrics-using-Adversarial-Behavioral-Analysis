Certainly. From where will you be departing?
I want to depart from Peterborough and want to leave after 18:00.
Where will your destination be?
To Cambridge.
train TR9332 leaves at 19:17 and it costs 23.60 pounds. i have booked you one ticket. is there anything else i can help you with?
That train would work well, but I really need 2 tickets and the reference number please.
Okay, I've got you booked on the TR9332. Your reference is WG0QUAVB and the total fee of 47.2 GBP is payable at the station. Will that be all today?
i also want a place to stay
There are 33 locations available. Is there a specific area you wish to stay in?
Yes, I'd like to be in the east. It will also need to have a star of 4.
Do you have a price range in mind?
Just one that has free wifi please. No price range restrictions.
Based on your criteria there are 6 guest houses available. I suggest the carolina bed and breakfast. Shall I make a reservation for you?
