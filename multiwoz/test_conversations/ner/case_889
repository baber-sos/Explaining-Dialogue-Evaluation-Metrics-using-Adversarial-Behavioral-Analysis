Can you help me find a place to go in the centre?
I can help you with that. Is there a certain kind of attraction that you would like to visit?
Surprise me. Give me the postcode as well.
Would you prefer The Castle Galleries is a museum in the centre of town. Their post code is cb23bj
Great! I'm also looking for a place to eat in the same area. Something not too expensive, but not cheap.
There are 21 places in the centre of town. What type of cuisine would you like?
I am interested in moderately priced international food.
I'd recommend the Varsity Restaurant. Would you like to book a table?
