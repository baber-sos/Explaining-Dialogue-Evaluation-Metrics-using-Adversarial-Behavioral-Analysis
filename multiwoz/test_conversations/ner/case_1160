I am looking for the gardenia restaurant a friend told me to try.
Your friend has good taste. It is located at 2 Rose Crescent City Centre, postcode cb23ll.
I'd like to book a table for 7 people on Monday at 15:15 please.
No problem! I've booked you a reservation at the gardenia for Monday at 15:15 for 7 people. The reference number is 3B3402QR . Is there anything else?
