Hello, I would like to find a hotel that includes free parking.
Most of the hotels in town offer free parking. Is there a certain area you'd like to stay in, or do you have a price range in mind?
Yes. The centre would be nice and also free wifi.
The University Arms is an expensive, 4 star hotel with free wifi. Comparatively, the Alexander Bed and Breakfast is a cheaply priced guesthouse, also 4 stars.
Please book me some rooms for The University Arms to accommodate 8 people for 3 nights starting on wednesday. Can you also provide me the reference number after you book?
