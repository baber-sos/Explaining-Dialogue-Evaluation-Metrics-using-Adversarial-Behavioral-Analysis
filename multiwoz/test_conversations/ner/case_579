Hi, I'm looking to catch a train to Norwich. Are there any that depart at or around 17:00?
There are departures most days from Cambridge at 17:36. Would you like any more information of train times or help booking a train?
Does that train leave on Friday?
Yes! We have 7 trains leaving on Friday to Norwich. What time would you like to arrive by?
No preference.
The train closest to your preferred departure time is TR3833, going from Cambridge to Norwich at 17:36. Would you like me to book that for you?
