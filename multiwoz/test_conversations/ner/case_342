Hi, I'm looking for a place to stay that is moderate prices, and has free wifi please.
There are many places that meet your criteria, what part of town would you like to stay in?
i would like to stay somewhere that has free parking
There are 14 hotels in the area that match your criteria, would you be interested in the Arbury Lodge Guesthouse?
I'm looking for a hotel that has a star rating of 2 as well, do any of those 14 hotels have a 2 star rating?
There are 2 hotels and both are located in the north. The Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Hotel. Would you like more information on one of these?
Can you give me the address, hotel type, and phone number for either of the hotels?
Sure. The Lovell is indeed a hotel, not a guesthouse. You can find it at 365 milton road. Their phone number is 01223425478.
And that is a 2 star hotel, correct? Are there any attractions I could visit in the centre?
Yes, the Lovell is indeed a 2 star location. Might I suggest the Cambridge Arts Theatre for your entertainment during your stay? It's a highly recommended experience.
That sounds perfect. Can I get the postcode of the Cambridge Arts Theatre please?
