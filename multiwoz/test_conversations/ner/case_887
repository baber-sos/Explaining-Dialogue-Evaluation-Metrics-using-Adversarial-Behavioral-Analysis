I am looking to get on a train that departs from Ely on Thursday
There are 10 results of trains departing from Ely on Thursday. All are destined for Cambridge. Do you have any specific times that you would like me to look up?
The train should leave at 18:45
There's a train at 19:35 arriving Cambridge at 19:52. Would you like me to book it for you?
