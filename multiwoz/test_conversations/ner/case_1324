Hi, I am looking for a cheap place to stay that has free wifi. Can you find anything like that?
I have ten entries that meet your requirements! What area of town would you like?
I don't care about the area but I need one with 3 stars, please.
Unfortunately, I don't show any cheap hotels that have a 3-star rating. Can I look in a different price range or star rating for you?
Can you see if there are any in the moderate range?
We have 3 moderately priced 3 star guesthouses.
Great! Which of those three would you recommend?
Which are would you like to stay in?
Please just pick the best one and book it for Thursday.
