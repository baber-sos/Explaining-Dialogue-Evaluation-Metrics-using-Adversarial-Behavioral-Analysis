Hi, I'm looking for a nightclub in town please.
There are several nightclubs in town. I recommend ballare. It is found in the center of town.
Okay, could you tell me he postcode and the entrance fee?
Sure thing! Entry fee is 5 pounds and postcode is cb23na.
I would also like to eat in the center of town.
We have many dining options available in city centre. Do you have a price range or style of food you would prefer?
Are there any steakhouses in the centre?
Unfortunately not. Do you want to broaden your search?
Can you find something with italian food instead?
Oh, great choice. I love Italian too. There are several options. How about Zizzi Cambridge?
That sounds great, what's the price range for Zizzi Cambridge?
Zizzi Cambridge is relatively cheap, but the food is sublime. Would you like me to book it for you?
