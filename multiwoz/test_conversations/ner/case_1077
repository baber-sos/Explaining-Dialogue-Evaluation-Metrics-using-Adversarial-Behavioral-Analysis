I'm looking for a restaurant that serves vietnamese food on the south side of town, is there anything like that?
There are no Vietnamese restaurants on the south side but there is one on the west side. Would that suffice?
What about on the east side? I would like for it to be expensive.
I'm sorry but there are not any Vietnamese restaurants on the East side of town, either.
Bummer, how about Indian food on the east side? I'm willing to pay for an expensive meal, if it's good!
There are 4 Indian restaurant on the East side ranging from moderately priced to expensive. Do you have a price preference?
Expensive would be fine. Can I have the address for the most expensive Indian restaurant out of the four?
How about the Pipasha Restaurant? It is in the expensive price range and serves Indian food. Their address is Newmarket Road Fen Ditton.
I would also like to check on museums on the east side. Can you see what you have in that area?
I have found four museums. 3 of them are free and one costs 5 pounds. Can I get you more information on any of them?
I need information on all of them please.
What information would you like? The phone number, address, or postcode?
the address please
I can give you the address for only one, is there one in particular you wish to learn more about?
Give me information on the one closest to Pipasha Restaurant.
They are all in the same general area, but Cambridge Artworks is nice. It is located at 5 Greens Road, cb13ef. You can call them at 01223902168.
