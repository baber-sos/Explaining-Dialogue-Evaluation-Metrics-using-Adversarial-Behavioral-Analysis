I'm looking for a moderately priced place to stay.
Certainly, we have many moderately priced options. Which area of town do you prefer to stay in?
I'm not familiar with the different areas, so I guess it doesn't matter. I would like a moderate though. With free WiFi.
The A and B Guest House is in the moderate price range and has free wifi. Would you like to book a room?
