Can you help me find a guesthouse in the north?
There are 11 guesthouses in the north. Do you have a price range?
No particular price range, but it should be 4 star rated.
Five of those guesthouses are rated four stars. Are there any particular commodities you need at the guesthouse?
I would like one with internet. What are the price ranges for those?
Actually, there are 8 guesthouses in the north with four stars and internet. 7 are in the moderate price range and one is on the cheaper side.
As long as it's a guesthouse in the north with 4 stars it'll be fine. Just recommend one to me please.
I found the Acorn Guest House, would you like me to book it for you?
No, I just need the address, price range and I need to know if they have internet.
They are a moderate priced guesthouse located at 154 chesterton road with free wifi. I can reserve that for you if you'd like.
No but I would like a train on wednesday at 15:30 from stansted airport to cambridge.
