I am looking for somewhere in South Cambridge with multiple sports attractions.
There are none available, do you have another attraction?
Okay. Can you search for some entertainment in the south part of town?
I have two places. Nusha and Tipin. Which would you prefer?
I would like Nusha. Can you give me the phone number and address for Nusha?
