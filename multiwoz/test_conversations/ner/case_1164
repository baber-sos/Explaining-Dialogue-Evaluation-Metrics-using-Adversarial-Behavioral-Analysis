I am looking for a cinema in cambridge.
We have two cinemas: Cineworld in the south, and Vue in the center of town.
That's great, thank you for your help!
Would you prefer something in the center of town, or in the South?
Any area is fine. I'm also looking for a restaurant in the centre that serves spanish food.
There are 2 restaurants that fit your criteria. Is there a price range you are looking for?
I would like something that is on the cheaper side.
Sure, la raza is spanish food and is cheap. Would you like to book a table?
Yes, I'd like a table for 8 at 11:15 on Sunday.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : N9PFYZML . Can I help you with anything else?
Yes I need a taxi between cinema and restaurant. What do you recommend?
I need more information to book that taxi. First, which cinema did you decide to visit?
I suppose the one in the centre makes more sense, since it's close to the restaurant.
So, you need a taxi between Vue Cinema, and La Raza?
Yes, that would be great. I need to make it to the restaurant by 11:15.
OK, a red volvo should be coming to pick you up and the Vue Cinema, contact number is 07177417862. Can I help you with anything else?
