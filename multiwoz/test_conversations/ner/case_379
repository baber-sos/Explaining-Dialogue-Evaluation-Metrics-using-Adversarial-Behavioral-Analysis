I'm looking for a 0 star hotel to stay at that includes free parking. Do you know of any?
I'm sorry, there isn't anything that matches those requirements. Can I look for something else?
I need a hotel with free wifi.
I don't have anything with that criteria. Can we try a different area?
Can you look again and search all areas.
I did find a 0 star guesthouse with those requirements. Does that interest you? Or would you like me to find a hotel with a different rating perhaps?
Can you find another one please?
There are 2 with 0 star ratings, would you prefer to be in the north area or centre?
Honestly it doesn't matter to me, either area will do just fine. Just make sure the hotel offers free wifi and parking.
May I suggest, city centre north b and b? Would you like me to book this for you?
Yes, please. Can you book a room for Monday for 2 people, 4 nights please?
SV6EZZ21 is your reference number for that booking. Is there anything else I can do?
I'd like to go to the theatre as well. Can you help me find one?
Sure, I can help you with that. There is 5 theatres in the city. 4 are in the the centre and 1 in the south. Do you have a preference?
You can pick one but please give me the entrance fee, area and address of what you pick.
The address of adc theatre is park street and the fee is not known.
In what area is the ADC Theatre?
