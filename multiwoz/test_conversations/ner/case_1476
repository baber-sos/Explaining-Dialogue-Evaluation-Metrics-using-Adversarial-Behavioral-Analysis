I am looking for a museum in the west to go to.
There are 7 museums in that area, did you want something with no entrance fee?
Yes, please. Can I get the address and postcode?
There are six free museums in the area. Are you interested in archeology, art exhibits or galleries? There is also a Cafe gallery.
I am most interested in a museum. Can you send me postcode and address. I also would like a cheap catalan restaurant, please.
Well, we have many museums. The Cambridge and County Folk Museum, for instance. Or the Museum of Classical Archaeology. What interests you?
I'll try the Folk Museum. Where can I find it?
