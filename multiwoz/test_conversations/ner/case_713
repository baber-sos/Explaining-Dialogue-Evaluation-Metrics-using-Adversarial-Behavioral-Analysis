I would like to find a museum in the west to go to.
There are several museums in the west. Some of the more popular ones are the museum of classical archaeology, the lynne strover gallery, and the cafe jello gallery
Can I have the address to the cafe jello museum?
The cafe jello gallery, is at 13 magdalene street Is there anything else?
