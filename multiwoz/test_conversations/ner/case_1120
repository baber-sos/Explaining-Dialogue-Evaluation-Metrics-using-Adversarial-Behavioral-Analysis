I'm hoping you can help me find an expensive hotel on the North end
There are no results. Is there another area we can search or a different price range?
I am looking specifically for a guesthouse in the expensive price range in the north. Can you look again please?
I'm sorry, there are no hotels meeting your requirements.
Perhaps you could check the moderate price range in the north area of town.
acorn guest house is very nice.
Okay, great! I'll need it booked for Sunday, 5 nights, and 5 people, please?
Your booking for the acorn guesthouse is successful. Your reference number is 5DR3NH3R . Can I help you with anything else?
Yes, I'm also looking for a place to dine. I'd like for it to be in the north and serve modern American food.
We don't have any that match. Do you have any other location preferences?
Okay can you look out for any in still the same location with the Hotel that serves asian oriental food.
saigon city is asian oriental. Want to book?
