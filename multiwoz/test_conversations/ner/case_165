I am planning a trip in Cambridge, looking for a place to dine
We have many great restaurants in Cambridge! Do you have a cuisine, area, or price range in mind?
I'm looking for an expensive place to eat in the centre of town
What type of food would you like to eat?
It doesn't matter. I'll just need to know the postcode, food type, and phone number, please?
How about darrys cookhouse and wine shop, they are at Regent Street City Centre, postal code cb21ab phone number is 01223312598
I'm also looking for a train that goes to cambridge.
Where will you be traveling from, and what day and time?
I need the train to leave from Peterborough on Sunday and I need it to leave after 12:00.
How about TR9345? It leaves at 12:19.
Yes, that sounds perfect. I need a reservation for 7 people. Can I have the reference number also? Thanks for your help!
Your reference number is YBX5LXOC . Is there anything else I can help you with?
No, that'll be all. Thanks!
I hope you have a great trip.
Thank you so much. Goodbye
Happy to be of service! I hope you enjoy your time in Cambridge.
