Hello! I am looking for information about The Cambridge Belfry. It's a hotel in Cambridge.
Certainly, it is a fantastic 4 star hotel in the west area that is very cheap with free wifi and parking! Would you like me to book it for you?
Before you book it, can I get the address of The Cambridge Belfry?
Of course! I have Back Lane, Cambourne listed as the address, is there anything else I can help with today?
No thank you, that is everything that I need.
Okay, thank you, and have a great day.
Thank you, have a great day, too.
Would you look for me to book The Cambridge Belfry for you?
Not right now. Can you recommend other places to visit in the center of town though?
I'd recommend The Man on the Moon concert hall on 2 norfolk street.
Could I get the phone number for the concert hall please?
Of course. Their phone number is 01223474144. What else can I help you with?
Nothing, that should be all today, thanks!
Thank you for contacting the Cambridge TownInfo centre. Have a good day.
