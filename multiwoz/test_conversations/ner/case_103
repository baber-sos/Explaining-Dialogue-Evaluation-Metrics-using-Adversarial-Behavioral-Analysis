I need to find somewhere to eat that is moderately priced in the city's center.
There are many great options to choose from. 21 in fact! Any particular type of cuisine you're looking for?
No, nothing in particular. Can you recommend one and give me the address?
I recommend Yippee Noodle Bar which is located at 40428 King Street City Centre. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Great I also am looking for a multiple sports attraction in the centre of town too.
I am sorry, there actually are not any multiple sports attractions in the centre. There is one located in the east, though.
How about a college?
There are a great number of colleges in the centre. Can I recommend Trinity College, on Trinity St? Entrance is only 1 GBP.
