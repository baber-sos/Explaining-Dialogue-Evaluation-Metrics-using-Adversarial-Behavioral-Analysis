I am looking for things to do on the west side of Cambridge. Is there anything you can recommend?
There are 13 different attractions on the west side. You have your choice of colleges, an entertainment venue, and museums. Which would you prefer to learn more about?
The entertainment venue sounds like a lot of fun. What is the address?
An entertainment venue meeting your request is Whale of a Time. The address is unit 8, viking way, bar hill.
Perfect, thanks. Oh! I'm also quite hungry, can you recommend an expensive restaurant in town that serves molecular gastronomy cuisine, please?
Unfortunately, I don't have any restaurants that serve molecular gastronomy cuisine at the moment. Can I look for another type of cuisine for you?
Are there no molecular gastronomy restaurants in the West side or in the entire city?
Unfortunately there are none in the city. Would you like to try another type of food?
How about an Indian restaurant?
I have 5 different indian expensive restaurants in the west. Might I recommend the India House. They have great reviews.
Whatever you recommend works, I need to book for 2 people at 18:00 on thursday.
I've got your table reserved, reference number FUKN64LF .
Thanks. Can I get a taxi from Whale of a Time to The India House? I would like to get to the restaurant by 18:00.
