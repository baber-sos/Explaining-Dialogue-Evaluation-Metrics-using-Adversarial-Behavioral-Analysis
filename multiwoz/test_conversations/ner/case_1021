I need a train that departs from Ely on Thursday.
We have 10 trains leaving from Ely on Thursday. Where would you like to go?
I would like to go to Cambridge after 18:00.
We have three trains departing from Ely after 18:00. The earliest departing at 19:35 and arriving by 19:52. It'll be a 17 minute trip.
I would like to book the 19:35 train for 7 people. I will need the reference number, please.
I have booked your train for 7 people. 30.8 GBP will be payable at the station. The reference number is MTT3EDCU . Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes, I'm also looking for a place to stay in the north. I do need free parking.
OK I found 11 places fitting your requirements. Do you need free WIFI?
