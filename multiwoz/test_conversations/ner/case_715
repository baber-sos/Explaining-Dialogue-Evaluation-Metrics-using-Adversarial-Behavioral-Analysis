I am looking for information about the Ruskin Gallery in Cambridge.
The Ruskin Gallery is a museum in the center of town.
Ok, great. Thank you so much for your help.

Real quickly, actually. Can I get a train booked as well? For Thursday to cambridge.
Of course. There are 202 trains into Cambridge this Thursday. Where will you be departing from, and what time would you like to arrive?
I want to arrive by 17:45
Where will you be departing from?
I'm coming in from the london liverpool street station.
There are potentially 7 trains that fit your needs. When do you wish to depart London Liverpool?
