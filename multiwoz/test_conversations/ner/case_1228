I'm looking for a place to sleep, not too expensive but not bargain basement, either.
Okay! What part of town would you like to stay in?
I'd like to stay in the north.
There are many such hotels and guesthouses, we can narrow it down if we know if you need parking or WiFI.
I would prefer a guesthouse. I don't care about the other amenities.
We have 9 guest houses that meet your criteria. Would you like me to recommend one?
Yes, please pick one for me. I need to book for 6 people from tuesday through thursday.
Can you please confirm, will you be departing on Thursday or Friday morning?
I need it for two nights starting tuesday. So I will be leaving THURSDAY.
