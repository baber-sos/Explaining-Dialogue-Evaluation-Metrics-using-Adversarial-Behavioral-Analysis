Looking for hotel with 4 star in the center of town.
The University Arms Hotel is fantastic. It's expensive, but worth the cost.
Can you book it for me and get a reference number ?
for how many should i book?
I actually need to book a specific hotel called, the archway house.
that is a guesthouse located in north and is moderately priced.
Please book that for 8 people for two nights starting on saturday.
