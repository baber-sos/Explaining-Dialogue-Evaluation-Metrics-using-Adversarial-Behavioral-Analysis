I'm writing an article on places in cambridge with no stars. Can you help me find a place to stay that has free wifi?
There are three places that meet those specifications: City Centre North B&B, El Shadda and Cityroomz. How else can I help you?
Are any of these hotels in the expensive price range?
I'm sorry, there aren't any in the expensive range. Cityroomz is in the moderate range, the others are in the cheap range, are you interested in any of those?
Are there any expensive hotels that have 4 stars?
Oh yes indeed, 21 in fact! Do you want to visit all of them for your article, or would you like to narrow it down some more?
Do any of the locations you have found offer free parking?
Almost all of them have free parking.
Ok, is there one that you would recommend?
My apologies, there are only two 4 star hotels in the expensive category, the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel and the University Arms Hotel. The University Arms seems to be popular choice.
Ok, I also want to find a train from cambridge to peterborough on sunday please i want to be there by 13:00.
