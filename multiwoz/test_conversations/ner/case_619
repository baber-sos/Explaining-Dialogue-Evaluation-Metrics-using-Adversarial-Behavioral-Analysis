I need to find a hotel that has free parking.
Sure I can help with that. What area will you be staying in?
In the centre, I more specifically am looking for a guesthouse with a 0 star rating in that area.
El Shaddai is a 0 star guesthouse located in the centre has both free parking and wifi. What days are you interested in staying there? can I book for you?
