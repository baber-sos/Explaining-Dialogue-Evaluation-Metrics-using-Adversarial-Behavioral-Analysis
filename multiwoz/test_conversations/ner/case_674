Hi, I am looking for a train that leaves on Tuesday after 18:15.
Certainly! What are your departure and destination locations?
It should leave from Cambridge and go to Leicester please.
Thanks for that information. Is there a time you would like to arrive by?
I do not have an arrival time.
The TR0776 leaves Cambridge at 18:21 and gets into Leicester at 20:06. Do you want me to book it for you?
