Hi there, I'm looking for a restaurant that serves Swedish food. It can be anywhere, I'm willing to pay a moderate amount of money. Do you have any recommendations?
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find anything that matches your request. Shall we look for a cheap or expensive Swedish restaurant instead?
