Hi, could you tell me some attractions in Cambridge?
Hello, there are some wonderful museums and most of them are free entrance. We have Holy Trinity Church located on Market St.
A swimming pool sounds like much more fun, doesn't it?
There are four pools, abbey pool and astroturf pitch, jesus green outdoor pool, kings hedges learner pool, and parkside pools. Which would you like?
Any one of those is fine. May I get the entrance fee?
I'm, sorry, but the entrance fee is not listed. Would you like a phone number for one of them?
Yes. I am also looking for a train, leaving on Friday after 10, depart cambridge, going to leicester.
