I need a hotel for tonight please.
I can help you with that. Do you have a particular price point you are looking for?
It doesn't matter but I do need free parking.
I have several hotels matching your request available. What part of town would you prefer?
I have no preference on the part of town, but I do need free wifi as well.
ok, that narrows it down to 8 options for you. any other preferences?
I would like it to be a guesthouse.
Well there are 21 of those spread across town so I recommend the arbury lodge guesthouse on the North side. Would you like me to book it?
Yes can you please?
What day would you like me to book the hotel for?
I apologize for not mentioning it before, Please book it starting sunday for 1 person for five days?
