I am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should include free wifi and should be in the moderate price range
I have three hotels. Two in the north and one in the centre. Do you have a preference?
No, but should come with free parking.
How does the Lovell Lodge sound? It has internet and free parking and is moderately priced.
Sure. please book for 1 person for 4 nights starting on friday.
I'm sorry but the booking was unsuccessful. Would you like to book starting another day? Or perhaps a shorter stay?
Can we try for it for wednesday instead?
yes, that booking was successful for Wednesday. The reference number is J4Q4W07K . Anything else you need?
