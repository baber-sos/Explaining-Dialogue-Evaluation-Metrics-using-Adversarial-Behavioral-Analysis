Can you help me find a restaurant for from trip?
Do you have any food preferences?
I would like some Italian food.
There are 15 italian restaurants. Is there an area and/or pricepoint you would like to stay in?
Yes, I'd like a moderate price range, and a restaurant on the south side.
I have just one place available. It is Pizza Hut Cherry Hinton. They are moderately priced and are located at G4 Cambridge Leisure Park Clifton Way Cherry Hinton.
Please make reservations for 7 people at 19:30 on friday.
