I'm interested in rooms for the night where you can get free wifi.
There are 32 hotels or guesthouses with free wifi. What price range are you looking for?
I'm looking for something in a moderate price range, but it must have at least a 4 star rating.
What part of town are you interested in? East, north or south?
I don't have a preference for the area.
How about a and b guest house?
that will be nice. get me the reference numbers
When would you like to book this for?
Please book for Sunday for 3 nights and 6 people.
Sorry, the hotel can't accommodate you for that time frame? Want to try a different date?
No, I need it for those days. Can you try different hotel?
I can try for the Acorn Guest House, if you'd like. They're on Chesterton Road.
Sounds good. Can you try and book that one please.
Sorry, the Acorn Guest house is not able to accomodate you either. I checked with the other moderately priced 4 star lodgings with free wifi, and none have those dates available. Will any other stay work for you?
