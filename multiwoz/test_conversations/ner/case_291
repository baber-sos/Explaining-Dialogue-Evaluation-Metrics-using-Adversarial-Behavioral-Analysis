Hi, what options are available in the south of Cambridge for upscale dining?
Is there a particular cuisine you are looking for?
I'm not picky, just let me know a few types of cuisine that are in the area please.
Peking Restaurant as well as The Good Luck Food Takeaway serve Chinese food. Taj Tandoori serves Indian, and Frankie and Benny's serves Italian. There is also a Mexican restaurant, Chiquito.
