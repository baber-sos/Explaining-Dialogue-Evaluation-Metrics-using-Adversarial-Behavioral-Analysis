We're looking for a place to stay in Cambridge. We're looking for a hotel with free wifi and free parking.
We have many hotels all over the city. When would you like to book the rooms for and how long is your stay?
I would prefer a hotel in the moderate price range.
The Ashley hotel and the Lovell lodge are both hotels in the north, moderate price range with offer free wifi and parking. Which one do you prefer?
I don't have a preference. I need to make a reservation for 6 people for 5 nights starting Wednesday.
I've set up reservations for 6 at the Lovell Lodge, starting on Wednesday and for 5 days. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
I am also in need of a train leaving peterborough.
Ok first train leaves at 05:19 and the last one runs at 07:19, would you like me to get you a ticket?
I need to leave after 21:45. Do you have maybe more you didn't see?
I have one that leaves at 21:48. What day would you like to travel?
I want to leave the same day as the hotel booking which is Wednesday. By the way, may I have the reference number for Lovell Lodge, too?

I want to leave the same day as the hotel booking which is those 3 days. By the way, may I have the reference number for Ballare, too?
