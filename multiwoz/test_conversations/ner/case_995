Hi, I am looking forward to eat at your local restaurants on my upcoming trip. I have those planned, but could use some help with places to go in town.
Do you have any food type, price range, and location preferences?
You know what, I change my mind. Let's look for an attraction for entertainment in the centre of town.
There are lots of attractions is there anything specific you are looking for?
I am looking for a entertainment please.
There's nothing matching that criteria. Do you want to search in a different area?
No. I'm thinking it may be nice to visit a college. Can you please recommend one of those?
There are 5. I recommend Downing College.
How far away is it from the All saints Church ?
