Hello, I am looking to book a train that will be departing Cambridge after 13:15.
The first train leaves at 15:00 and they run every 51 minutes.
I'd like to go to Birmingham New Street on Thursday and leave after 13:45. Do you have anything that would work for me?
I have a train that leaves Cambridge 14:01 arriving in Birmingham New Street at 16:44. Would that work?
That should work, what is the travel time on that?
That would be 163 minutes.
That works. I'm also looking for an attratiction that is college type.
There are 18 different colleges in cambridge. Did you wish to go to a certain part of town?
