Hi, I'm looking for places to go in Cambridge. Preferably a museum in the centre of town.
You could check out the cambridge contemporary art museum on 6 trinity street.
That sounds nice. Can you give me their phone number please?
Certainly, it is 01223324222. Anything else I can help you with?
Yes, I'm interested in a hotel called rosa's bed and breakfast. Can you tell me about that?
