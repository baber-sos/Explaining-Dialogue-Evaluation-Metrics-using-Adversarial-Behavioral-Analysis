I am looking for a museum in the west part of town to visit.
I have seven museums in the west. 6 of them are free, and one has an entrance fee. Do you have any specific museum you want to visit?
I do not have a specific museum I want to visit.
Would you rather have a free museum or go to one with an entrance fee?
I'd like the address for the one with the entrance fee please.
The cambridge and county folk museum is located at 2-3 castle street postcode cb30aq , it has an entrance fee of 3.50 pounds.
Thanks. Now I need to book a train from Norwich.
There are 133 trains leaving norwich. What day and time are you interested in?
