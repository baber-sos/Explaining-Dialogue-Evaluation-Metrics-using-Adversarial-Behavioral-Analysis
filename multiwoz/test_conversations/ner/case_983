I am looking forward to trying local restaurants but would like help finding a place to go in town. I would like it to be in the south and a swimmingpool
I'm sorry, I'm experiencing a system error. Could you please restate your request?
I want a place to go in the south, a swimmingpool. Or another type of entertainment, if there is no pool?
I'm sorry, but there are not any swimming pools in the south area.There are 2 parks and a cinema. Are you interested in one of these? Or something else?
Yes, are there any entertainment attractions then?
There are two attractions listed, Nusha and Tenpin. Would you like more information about them?
Can I have the entrance fee for the Nusha, as well as the phone number?
The entrance fee isn't shown. The phone number for Nusha is 01223902158. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Yes, can you please find me a good Indian restaurant in the same area as the attraction? Money is no object.
Yes, the Taj Tandoori is a great Indian place in the south area of the city. It's expensive, but definitely worth it. Would you like a reservation there?
