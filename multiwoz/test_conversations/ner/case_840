I am looking for suggestions for a cheaper restaurant in the center of town.
I have several listings available for you to choose from, is there any preference on the type of food they serve for you?
Not really. Just get me a table for 3 on Tuesday at 17:00
Would you like me to book you a table at Dojo Noodle Bar at 40210 Millers Yard City Centre for Tuesday at 17:00 for 3 people?
