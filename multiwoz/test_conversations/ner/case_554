I am looking for information in Cambridge.
What can I help you with?
I would like info on train travel.
What day would you like to travel? Where are you departing and arriving to?
I'd like to leave on Saturday. Any train is fine. I'll just need the departure time and price.
Where are you leaving from and where are you going to?
The train should arrive by 11:45 in Cambridge. I am leaving on Saturday from Birmingham New Street on Saturday. Also need places to go in the east side of town.
I have a train departing Birmingham New Street on Saturday at 22:40 and arriving in Cambridge at 1:23. Tickets are 60.08 pounds, would you like to book this train?
