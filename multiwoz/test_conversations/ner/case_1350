I need to find a train going to Leicester that arrives by 4:45 PM. Do you know of one?
There are many trains going to leicester at the time, where are you departing from and on what day?
I am departing from Cambridge on Friday.
TR0623 leaves at 14:21 and will arrive at leicester at 16:06. The trip will take 105 minutes and will cost 37.80 pounds. Would you like to book?
