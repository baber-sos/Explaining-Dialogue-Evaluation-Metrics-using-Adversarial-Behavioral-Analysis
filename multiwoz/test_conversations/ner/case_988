Hello! I am looking to book reservations at Sala Thong.
Ah yes, I have that right here. It's an expensive Thai restaurant in the west end. How many people would you like to reserve a table for, and what day/time?
That's all the info I needed. Thanks.
Are you sure you don't need help with anything else?
I'd also like to know if there's a swimmingpool in the east.
Abbey pool and astroturf pitch is in the east. Would you like the address and postal code?
Just the address would be fine. Thanks.
Sure thing. The address is pool way, whitehill road, off newmarket road. Can I help with anything else?
Yes, I need a taxi from the pool to the restaurant, I would like to leave the pool place at 10:00
Booking complete! A grey Toyota will collect you at Abbey Pool and Astroturf Pitch at 10:00, heading to Sala Thong. The driver's contact number is 07847553074. Will that be all today?
