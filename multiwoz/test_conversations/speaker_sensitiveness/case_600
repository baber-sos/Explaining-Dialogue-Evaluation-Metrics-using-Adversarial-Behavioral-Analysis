I am looking for some where to go, in the centre of town.
Do you have an idea of what type of attraction you would be interested in?
Yes, I would like to visit a park, please.
The Cambridge University Botanic Gardens is located in the city centre. Would you like the address?
Yes, that would be great. I will need a train also.
The address is bateman street cb21jf. May I ask where you'll be traveling via the train?
