I'm starving! Can you find me somewhere to eat on the south side of the city? Money is no object so please find me something expensive.
We have several options available to you. What type of cuisine would you prefer? We have Chinese, Indian, Italian, and Mexican as options.
Whichever one you recommend, as long as its expensive. I'll need a reservation for 4 at 15:45 on saturday.
I was able to book you at the peking restaurant, the reference number is 3TFBGBP8, the table will be held for 15 minutes, is there anything else, that I can assist with?
Yes, could you please recommend some places to go after we get done eating that are near the restaurant as well?
The "Place" is a popular nightclub in the area. There are also a couple of other entertainment options.
The "Place" sounds good, can I get its postcode, please?
The postcode for that attraction is cb23hg. Is there anything more I can help with today?
No, that's all I need. Thank you so much for your help.
Thank you for contacting Cambridge TownInfo centre. Goodbye!
