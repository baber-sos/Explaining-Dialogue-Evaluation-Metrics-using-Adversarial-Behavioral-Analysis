I would like to find an expensive turkish restaurant.
Wonderful! There's one I've found that's in the centre of the city. Would you like the address?
Yes I would like the address please!
The address is 196 Mill Road City Centre, post code cb13nf.
Thank you, that is all. Good day to you.
Thank you and have a great day!
I am also looking for a train that arrives at Norwich.
There are 133 trains that go to norwich! We'll need to narrow that down. Where are you leaving from?
I need to depart from cambrige, on thursday, and arrive by 10:45.
Is there a time you need to leave after?
