Yes, as long as its leaving Cambridge on friday....thank you

Booking was successful, the total fee is 50.5 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : 3R5W0FNB . Is there anything else I can help with today?
I would like to find a German restaurant in the center of town.
I'm sorry, there are no results for a German restaurant in the town centre area. Would you like me to look in other areas, or try for another cuisine?
What options are there for moderately priced restaurants at the centre?
There are 21 various restaurants in town centre. Possibilities include british food, asian oriental, italian, turkish, international. Do any of those sound good to you?
Is the asian oriental food Chinese food or from another country?
I'm not sure I understand your request. Could you be a little more specific?
I would like to book a Chinese restaurant is that clear?
Yes, I understand you now. There are three restaurants with Chinese cuisine to choose from: the Jinling Noodle Bar, the Lan Hong House, and the Shanghai Family Restaurant.
Are all 3 of those restaurants moderately priced and in the centre of town?
Yes , all of them are. Which one could you like me to book for you?
Let's try the Lan Hong House. I'll need a table for 5 at 14:45 Friday.
Excellent choice. I have booked Lan Hong House for Friday at 14:45, party of 5. The reference number is BHRH5JY4 .
