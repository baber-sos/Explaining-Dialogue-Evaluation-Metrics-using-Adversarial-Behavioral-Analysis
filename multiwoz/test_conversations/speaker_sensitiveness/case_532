I'm looking for a theatre to visit in the centre of Cambridge. Can you help me with this?
I can recommend the adc theatre on park street or the cambridge arts theatre located at 6 st edward's passage
Are either in the city center?
Both are located in the city centre.
Can you give me the address of the ADC Theatre please?
