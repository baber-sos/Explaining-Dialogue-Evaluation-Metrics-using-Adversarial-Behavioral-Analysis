I want to find an Italian place to eat near the center of cambridge.
There are nine possibilities to choose from. What price range do you have in mind?
I would like for the restaurant to be expensive.
I'd recommend Don Pasquale Pizzeria. Would you like more information on them or to book a reservation?
I would like to book a table for 2
Great, what day and time would you like to book for?
I need the reservation for saturday at 18:15 and I need the reference number too.
OK, your table is reserved and your Reference number is : 06DKVN3K . Can I help you with anything else today?
