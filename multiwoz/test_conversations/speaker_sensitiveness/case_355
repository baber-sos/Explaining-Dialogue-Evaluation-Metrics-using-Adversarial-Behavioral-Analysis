I am looking for a restaurant in Cambridge called The Missing Sock.
The missing sock is an international restaurant in the east. The address is Finders Corner Newmarket Road. Do you need any further information?
Yes, can you give me a phone number please?
Certainly. Their phone number if 01223812660. Can I help you with anything else?
I am also looking to book a train leaving after 18:30 to go to Kings lynn.
There is a train on friday that leaves at 8:11pm. Does that work?
I'm looking for one that leaves on Tuesday after 18:30. Is there anything available?
There are 5 that could work. How about the TR0525, it leaves at 19:11 and arrives in Kings Lynn at 19:58?
Yes it does. Can you book the train for 8 people?
I was able to successfully book those tickets for you. Your reference number is QZ3BIX9U . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Great that's all I needed today, thank you!
