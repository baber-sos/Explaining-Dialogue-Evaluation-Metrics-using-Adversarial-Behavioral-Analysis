Hello, I am trying to find an attraction in the west part of town. Can you help me?
Sure, there are many colleges and museums in the west, there is also some entertainment. Do you have a preference on any of these?
Not really. Could you give me the postcode for one of the museums?
The one I recommend is the People's Portraits Exhibition at Girton College. It's free to get in. Their postcode is cb3ojg. Is there any other information I can provide?
Thank you. That's all I need today. Goodbye.
