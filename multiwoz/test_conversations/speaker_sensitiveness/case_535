Please find a restaurant in the north that serves unusual food.
I apologize, we don't have any restaurants that serve unusual food in the north.
No thank you that will be all
Can I help you find a different type of food?
How about a Chinese restaurant?
There are three Chinese food restaurants in the north side of town. Two are expensive and the other is moderately priced. Do you need more information?
Can you recommend one of those?
I'd recommend the Hotpot. Would you like a reservation or more information?
Yes could you give me their postcode?
The postcode for The Hotpot is cb41ep. Would you like a reservation?
What price range is that in?
It's in the expensive price range. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Are there any swimming pools in the same area as the restaurant?
Yes there are two pools. I highly suggest the Jesus Green Outdoor Pool. Would you like more information?
Yes, that sounds great can you send me all the info.
