I'm starving! Can you find me somewhere to eat on the south side of the city? Money is no object so please find me something expensive.
We have several options available to you. What type of cuisine would you prefer? We have Chinese, Indian, Italian, and Mexican as options.
Whichever one you recommend, as long as its expensive. I'll need a reservation for 4 at 15:45 on saturday.
I was able to book you at the peking restaurant, the reference number is 3TFBGBP8, the table will be held for 15 minutes, is there anything else, that I can assist with?
