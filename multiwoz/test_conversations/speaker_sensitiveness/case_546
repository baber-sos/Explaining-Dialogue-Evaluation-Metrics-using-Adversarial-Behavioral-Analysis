Good Morning, are there any expensive restaurants in the city centre?
i have quite a few restaurants, is there is particular type of food you are looking for?
No, can you choose one for me and provide me with the postcode.
How about the Kymmoy that serves asian oriental? The postcode is cb12as.
That sounds great. Thanks so much!
You're welcome, would you like me to make a reservation for you?
