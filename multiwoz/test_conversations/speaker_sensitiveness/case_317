I'm looking for a hotel with at least a three-star rating.
We have 6 hotels and guesthouses that have 3 star ratings. Is there a particular part of town, or a particular price range that you're interested in?
I'm not to worried about price but the hotel needs to have free wifi.
The gonville hotel is in the centre and the lensfield hotel is in the south.They both have free wifi. Would you like me to book one for you?
Not just yet. I'm just getting info now.
Understood. Do you need anything else then?
Oh I forgot to mention I would actually like something in the moderate price range.
We have 4 to choose from now. Any other preferences?
Are they all guesthouses?
Yes, they are all guesthouses. Can I suggest the hamilton lodge, a 3 star, moderately priced guesthouse with wifi, in the north area?
Please give me the number to the hamilton lodge.
