I'm looking for a train that leaves on tuesday to cambridge, please.
kindly narrow down your specifications so that i can find you a train that suits you best, like time of arrive and departure
I want to depart from Stevenage and would like to arrive in Cambridge by 16:30.
What time would you like to leave at?
I don't care about departure time as long as I get there before 16:30.
Alright, TR1830 arrives by 14:43, does that suit your needs?
Yes, I think that will work. Can I get the price and departure time for that train?
It costs 12.80 pounds and it leaves at 13:54. Would you like me to book you seat?
