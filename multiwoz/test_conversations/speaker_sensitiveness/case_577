What is the travel time and price?
It is a short trip, just 17 minutes and the cost is 4.40 pounds.
i also need somewhere to sleep
I'd be happy to help. May I ask what price range and area of town you are looking for?
I need a 4 star hotel.
There are more than 20 hotels that are 4 star. Is there a certain part of town that you would like to stay in?
How about something in the expensive price range with free wifi?
Sure, I recommend university arms hotel in the centre, would you like me to make a reservation for you?
