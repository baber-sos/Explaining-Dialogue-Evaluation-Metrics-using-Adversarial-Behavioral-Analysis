Are there any Catalan restaurants in the centre of town?
I'm sorry, there are no Catalan dining establishments in the city centre. Would you like to look for a different cuisine or area?
Actually, can you try anything that serves French food?
I have the cote in the centre. It is in the expensive range. Would you like to make a booking?
Yes, please. I need a table for 8 on Friday at 17:30, please.
