Hello, I am looking for a restaurant in the town centre that serves British food.
There are 7 restaurants in the centre of town that serves British food. Is there any particular price range you are looking for?
Yes, I'm looking for a moderately priced restaurant with British food.
I can recommend Restaurant One Seven. Would you like to book a table with them?
Sure. I will be booking 3 people at 17:45 on Wednesday. Could i also get the reference number, please?
Your reservation is complete for a party of 3 at 17:45 at a British Restaurant One Seven in centre, and your confirmation # is VLJLK60E .
I also need a hotel in the same price range as the restaurant.
There are 18 hotels in the Moderate price range, would you like me to narrow these down by searching other amenities or location?
I would like something that is 2 stars and includes free parking.
I have 2 options with those specifications. The Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge both with free wifi and parking. Which would you prefer?
Could you book a room for 2 people, 2 nights on Wednesday at the Ashley, please?
Book was unsuccessful. Would you like to try the lovell lodge?
Sure, lets try that instead.
I was unable to book the Lovell Lodge for you on Wednesday. Do you want to try a different day or a shorter stay?
Can you try the Lovell Lodge for the Wednesday, please?
I am sorry. Lovell Lodge still has no bookings available for wednesday. Would you like to try a different hotel?
Yes, I need a 2 star hotel for 3 people for 2 nights on Wednesday, moderately priced, with free parking.
