I am planning a trip in Cambridge.
What part of your trip may I be of assistance with?
I am looking for a hotel that includes free wifi.
I have several options available. Do you prefer a cheap, moderate or expensive price range?
I prefer the hotel has at least a two star rating.
The Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge in the north are both moderately priced, two star hotels. There is also a more expensive option in the east. All have internet.
Which of those have free parking?
Both the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge have free parking.
Thank you. I believe I'll try the Lovell. Could you give me their phone number, please?
