I am looking for corsica restaurants in the east of cambridge, can you help me?
Unfortunately there is not a corsica restaurant in the east of cambridge, is there another type of food you would like to look for?
I'll think about it. I would like a moderately priced restaurant, I know that.
How about curry prince? It is a moderately priced indian restaurant in the east.
