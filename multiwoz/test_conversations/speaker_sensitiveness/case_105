I'd like a train from Cambridge to Broxbourne, please.
There are 133 trains making that trip, do you have a day and time you'd like to go?
Yes. I would like to leave on Sunday after 20:30.
TR7208 leaves at 21:01. Would you like me to book it?
Yes and could I have the reference number after?
Great, I have booked your ticket, your reference number is : NJRE41ZT . May I help you with anything else today?
No thank you. Have a great day!
