Hello, I would like to find a hotel that includes free parking.
Most of the hotels in town offer free parking. Is there a certain area you'd like to stay in, or do you have a price range in mind?
Yes. The centre would be nice and also free wifi.
The University Arms is an expensive, 4 star hotel with free wifi. Comparatively, the Alexander Bed and Breakfast is a cheaply priced guesthouse, also 4 stars.
Please book me some rooms for The University Arms to accommodate 8 people for 3 nights starting on wednesday. Can you also provide me the reference number after you book?
Your reference number is X5NY66ZV .
Thank you. Can you please help me find a place to go in town in the same area as the hotel? Preferably a college.
There are no colleges close to the area you are requesting, would you like to chose another destination?
I believe there are some colleges in the centre of town. Can you please check again?
I am sorry but I rechecked and there are no colleges in that area. Is there anything else that I can do for you?
Hmmm, I was looking for the phone number and postcode of a college in the centre area. Could you help me with that?
I have 5 colleges in the centre area. What specific college are you looking for?
I'm looking for cambridge.
