Could really use some grub.
Sure. Is there any part of town that you'd like to look for food in?
Somewhere in the centre. I'm looking for some traditional food.
I'm sorry, but there aren't any traditional restaurants in the centre. Would you like to try another cuisine?
Ok, how about lebanese food?
Ali Baba is a great restaurant that fits exactly what you are looking for. Would you like me to book a table for you?
Yes, please book me a table for 2 people at 12:00 on wednesday.
I'm sorry, that isn't available. Is there another day or time you could eat?
How about at 11:00 instead?
Your reservation for 11:00 was successful and your reference number is Q1XUDH9Y . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Wonderful. Thanks for your help today. Bye.
Thank you, have a good day. Goodbye.
