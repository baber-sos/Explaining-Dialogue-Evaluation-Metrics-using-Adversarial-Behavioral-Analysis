Can you help me find a train going to leicester that arrives by 15:15?
Sure! What day are you traveling?
I will be leaving on Thursday.
Do you have a preference in departure time?
I would like to catch an early train. What time does the first train depart?
The first train departs at 5:21, but if you want to arrive at 15:15, the best train to take would be the TR1160 which will get there at 15:06.
