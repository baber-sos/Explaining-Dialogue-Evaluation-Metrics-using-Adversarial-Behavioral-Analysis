I'm looking for a restaurant that serves chinese food in the centre of town.
How about the Jinling Noodle Bar. I can reserve a table for you.
Is it expensive? I would like the restaurant to be expensive.
It is not, but the Ugly Duckling is. Would you like more information on that restaurant?
Please book a table for 7 at Ugly Duckling.
I'd be happy to! What day and time would you like for your reservation?
Please book the reservation for Thursday at 3:00pm and please provide me with a reference number.
Great it's all set RAQ4F5LX is the reference number
I'm also looking for a train to leave on Friday and go to Kings Lynn
Where are you departing from?
I'll be departing from Cambridge and want to leave after 15:15.
There's a train that leaves at 16:11 and arrives at 16:58. The price is 9.80 pounds. Would you like to book it?
Yes please, for the same number of people. Can you also get the reference number?
Your train tickets have been booked on train TR1911. Your reference number is 4BLMS5KM . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
I believe that's everything I needed for now. Thanks!
