Can you find a hotel named Worth House for me? Thanks.
Sure, it is a guesthouse in the north. Would you like me to book a room for you?
Can you tell me if they have free internet?
Yes, they have free wifi. Do you need anything else?
I would also like a train that leaves on Tuesday and arrive by 14:30.
There are many trains moving on Tuesday, can I get your preferred point of departure and arrival?
