I am coming to cambridge to try some good food, but would like to find a place to go in the centre area.
There are many good restaurants in the centre. Did you have a type of cuisine in mind?
I would like to go to an attraction first in the center of town. Are there any museums?
There are 11 museums in the centre. Would you like me to recommend one?
No but you can give me the phone number of your recommendation. What can you tell me about the golden curry restaurant?
The Golden Curry is an expensive Indian restaurant at Mill Road City Centre. Would you like for me to book you a table?
Please! Do they have availability for 8 people at 17:45 on Friday night?
Your booking was successful! The reference number is NGFEAHB8 . Your table will be reserved for 15 minutes.
I also need a taxi to go between the restaurant and hotel by the reservation time.
I will work on looking for that and be back with you in a moment.
Any luck on the taxi?
Before I can book the taxi I need to know what hotel you are staying at so the driver knows where to pick you up.
Actually I need the taxi from a museum to go to the restaurant. Whats a good museum to visit?
I personally like the Primavera museum in the city centre. It's free to get into. Would that interest you?
That sounds fine. Can I have a taxi go from there to the restaurant by 17:45?
Sure, you'll be expecting a black tesla. Their contact number is 07668622365
Thank you, that is all I need today!
