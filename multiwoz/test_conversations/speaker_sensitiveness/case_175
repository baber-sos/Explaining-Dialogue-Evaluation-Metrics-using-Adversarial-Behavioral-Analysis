Please find a restaurant called Nusha.
I don't seem to be finding anything called Nusha. What type of food does the restaurant serve?
I am not sure of the type of food but could you please check again and see if you can find it? Thank you.
Could you double check that you've spelled the name correctly? The closest I can find is Nandos.
It's not a restaurant, it's an attraction. Nusha.
