I'm looking for an expensive hotel with free wifi.
I have about 5 different ones all spread out over town. Do you have a certain preference on the area to stay in?
Not really on the area. But I would like an expensive guesthouse.
I'm afraid we don't have any guesthouses in that price range, can I offer you something else instead?
Ok, well I guess a cheap one would work just as well. I need a place to stay. I would just still need free wifi.
We have 9 guesthouse that are cheap with free wifi. Do you have any other specific needs?
No I don't think so. Which one sounds the best?
I think you'd enjoy the El Shaddai. Would you like to make a reservation?
Wait...is that a restaurant? I want a guesthouse. I'm so confused.
The El Shaddai is, indeed a cheaply priced guesthouse with free Wi-fi, according to our database. Perhaps they do both. May I make a reservation for you?
Oh, ok. Sure, go ahead and book 4 nights from Tuesday. There will be three of us.
