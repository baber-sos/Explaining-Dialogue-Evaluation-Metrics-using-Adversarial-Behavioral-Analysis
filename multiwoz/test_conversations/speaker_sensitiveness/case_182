Is there a restaurant that serves italian food in the expensive price bracket?
Yes, there are 5 such places. 4 are in the centre and 1 is in the south. Would you like to book at one?
Absolutely! Thank you!
Which area of town would you prefer?
How about the center?
Great, how about don pasquale pizzeria? May I book this for you?

No thanks. That will do it for me. Have a good day.
