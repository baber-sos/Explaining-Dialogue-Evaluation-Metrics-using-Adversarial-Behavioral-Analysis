Hello, I am looking for a train to cambridge that arrives by 17:15.
We'll find you something. Where are you departing from?
I am departing from London Kings Cross on Monday.
I have train TR9114 that leaves at 15:17 and will get you into Cambridge by 16:08. Would that work for you?
that is fine. get me the travel time
The travel time for the TR9114 is 51 minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes, I'm also looking for an expensive restaurant in the center of town.
i have 33 expensive restaurants in the centre of town. what type of food would you like?
The type of food is not important, but I need one that can seat 8 people at 21:00. Can you make a suggestion?
I would recommend the Cambridge chop house. It serves British food. Would you like me to try to make a reservation?
