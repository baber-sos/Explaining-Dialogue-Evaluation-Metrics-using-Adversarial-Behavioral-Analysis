I am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should include free wifi and should include free parking
There are many results with free wifi and parking, to help narrow it down, what area do you want to stay in?
north area in a guesthouse
what star rating?
It doesn't matter as long as I can book it for 2 people and 2 nights starting Thursday.
Did you have a price range in mind?
No, I am not picky.
Booking was not successful for that night at the acorn guest house, would you like me to try a different place?
how about wednesday instead?
Booking was unsuccessful. Would you like to try a different location?
Yeah try a different place. Anywhere that meets my requirements
