I need to find a train that departs from london liverpool street.
There are many options that may suit your needs. Is there a particular day you are wanting to travel on?
Yes I want to leave on Tuesday.
What time would you like to leave on?
I don't care about departure time, but I need to arrive by 10:15
There is a train departing at 07:39 and arriving by 09:07 that fits your needs. Would you like me to book it for you?
I'm not sure. How much is it?
16.6 GBP per ticket
I'm also looking for a place to dine. I need a restaurant in the south, in the expensive price range that serves mexican food.
I have chiquito restaurant bar. Would you like me to book that for you?
No, but I do need the phone number, address, and postcode please.
the address is 2G Cambridge Leisure Park Cherry Hinton Road Cherry Hinton cb17dy and the phone number is 01223400170.

It's no problem. Is there anything else I can help you with?
No, that is everything I needed. Thank you for your help!
Of course. Have a good one.
