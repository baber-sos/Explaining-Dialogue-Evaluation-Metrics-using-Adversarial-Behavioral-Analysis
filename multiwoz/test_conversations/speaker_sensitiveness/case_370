I would like to book a taxi to go to little saint mary's church after 11:00.
Can you tell me where the taxi will pick you up and when you want to arrive by?
I will be departing from Avalon.
Okay, I have booked a Red Volvo taxi for you to pick you up from Avalon. The contact number is 07604053685. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
What time will it arrive?
That really depends on traffic and route, you would have to call the taxi company to find out estimated drive times.
Thank you. I have all the information I need.
