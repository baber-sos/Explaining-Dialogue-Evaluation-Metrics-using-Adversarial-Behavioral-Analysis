I am looking for places to go in town I prefer a college.
How about Magdalene College? They're in the west side, and they have no entrance fee.
That sounds perfect. What is their address?
Their postcode is cb30ag an the entrance is free.
Okay what's their address?
The address is magdalene street. Would you like the phone number also?
