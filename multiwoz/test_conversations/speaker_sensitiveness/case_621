I am planning my trip to Cambridge and looking for a place to dine that is in the centre and is in the expensive price range
Bedouin servers african food and is in the centre of town in the expensive pricerange. Would you like their phone number, or should I book a reservation?
Please book a reservation for Wednesday at 20:00 for 5.
I was unable to book that time slot for you. Is there a different day or time that you would be interested in going?
We could probably go earlier in the evening. How about 1900?
I was able to successfully book your table for five. The reference number is U0FONNNA . Can I help you with anything else?
I am also looking for a particular attraction called Emmanuel College.
I was able to find it, it is located on saint andrew's street, phone number is 01223334200, and cb23ap is the postcode.
May I get the area its in, attraction type and an entrance fee if any?
It's a college located in the centre area. No entrance fee needed! Is there anything else I can help with?
Thank you for all of your help, that is all I need for today!
