I'd like to find an expensive place to eat in the south.
We have several available. Would you prefer Chinese, Indian, Italian or Mexican?
I really don't have a preference. How about Chinese? I will need their phone number and postcode please.
Sure, I think you'll like Peking Restaurant. Their postcode is cb28nx and their phone number is 01223354755. May I help with anything else?
