I am in need of an expensive Indian restaurant for dinner.
There are 14 such restaurants. Do you want to be in a specific part of town?
I don't care what part of town it is in, I would like a phone number please.
Sure, I'm sorry. I have Curry Garden their phone number is 01223302330. Would you like me to reserve a table for you?
Not at this time. I am looking for a 3-star hotel, though. No guesthouses.
I have found the Gonville Hotel. It is a 3 star hotel. Would you like me to book it for you?
