I want to find a moderately priced restaurant that has Spanish food.
La tasca is the only matching restaurant. It is in the center of town.
I would like to book at La tasca please.
Ok. When and for how many people?
I want to book a table for 2 people at 16:30 on wednesday.
I've booked your table for two for Wednesday at 16:30. Your Reference number is : NXLK0Z1U . Can I assist you with anything else today?
Yes, I'll need a train on the same day, departing from london kings cross.
I found 10 trains do you have a destination or time you would like to go?
