Hi, can you help me plan my Cambridge trip? I need a train from London Kings Cross to Cambridge.
I can help you with that. One leaves friday at 05:17, is that time okay for you?
Actually, I need to leave Tuesday after 10:30.
I have a train that leaves Tuesday at 11:17 that will arrive at 12:08. Would you like to make a reservation?
Yes, please make a reservation for 6 people. I'll need the reference number.
I was able to book your train. Your reference number is F13RS8CP . Is there anything else that you need?
I'm also looking for a place to eat. I would like an expensive south indian restaurant.
It looks like we don't have any of those. Would you like to try something else?
Hmm, are you sure? I want something south indian, expensive and in the centre of town.
I have curry garden for Indian in the centre of town, but no south indian.
What about one that serves mediterranean?
