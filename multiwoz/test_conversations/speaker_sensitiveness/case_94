I am planning my trip to Cambridge and looking for a place to dine that is in the centre and is in the expensive price range
Bedouin servers african food and is in the centre of town in the expensive pricerange. Would you like their phone number, or should I book a reservation?
Please book a reservation for Wednesday at 20:00 for 5.
I was unable to book that time slot for you. Is there a different day or time that you would be interested in going?
