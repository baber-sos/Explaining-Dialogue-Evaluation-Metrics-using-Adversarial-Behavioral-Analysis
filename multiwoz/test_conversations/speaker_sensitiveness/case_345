I am looking for information. Can you help me find a place to stay? I want a hotel, not a guestroom.
What area and/or price range would you like? If neither of those matter, I recommend the Gonville, in the center of town.
Moderate would be a perfect price range.
Do you have any other criteria?
Yes, a 2 star rating would be great.
we have two at the note, do i recommend one?
