I'd like to get a bite to eat in the east part of town.
Okay! What kind of cuisine would you like to eat?
I would really like indian food.
How about curry prince that serves indian food that is in the moderate price range?
Do you have anything expensive?
Yes! Would you like to try Pipasha Restaurant, or Sitar Tandoori?
Pipasha Restaurant would be great. Can you book a table for 6 at 16:30 on Wednesday?
