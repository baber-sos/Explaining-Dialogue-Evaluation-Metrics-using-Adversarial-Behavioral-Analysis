Hi, I would like to book a hotel in the north side of the city. Do you have any recommendations?
There are two hotels in the north. Both are in the moderate price range with Wi-Fi and parking. The ashley hotel is very popular. Should I book it?
I need free parking, and like a guesthouse over any other type.
If you like guesthouses there are a lot more options for you. I could recommend Archway House, they're moderately priced but rated four stars. Does that sound good?
Yes, it does. Could you see if you could book a party of 8 for 5 nights beginning Thursday?
I was able to book it, reference number is MFIGB1D2 .
Thank you very much, I would also like help with a train booking going to Leicester.
I will be more than happy to help you. Are you leaving from cambridge and what time and day will you be going?
Yes it should and I would like to arrive by 18:00
What day would you like to travel on?
