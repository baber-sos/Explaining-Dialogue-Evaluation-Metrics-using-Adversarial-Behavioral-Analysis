Where would I find the museum of archaeology and anthropology?
The Museum of Archaelogy and Anthropology is located at University of Cambridge, Downing Street. Their phone number is 01223333516. Do you need anything else?
And the attraction type is a museum, right?
Yes, it is a museum.
Sounds great. Thank you for the info!
No problem. Can I help you with anything else?
Yes, I need a place to dine that is expensive in the north please. European would be nice.
The only expensive European restaurant in the North is City Stop Restaurant. Would you like a reservation?
Yes actually. Book me a table for 2 people on sunday.... let's say 20:00?
It is not open then, another place or time perhaps?
It's not ideal, but maybe a little earlier would work. Say 19:00?
Got you your table, it'll be reserved for 15 minutes. Your reference number is: ZN0CVH11 . Anything else today?
No, thank you so much for your help today. Have a good day!
