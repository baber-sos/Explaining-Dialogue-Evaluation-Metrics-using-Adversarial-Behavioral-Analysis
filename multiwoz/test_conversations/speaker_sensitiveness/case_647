Oh, yes I'm hoping you can help me with finding a train departing out of Cambridge.
Certainly! Where would you like to go?
I need to go to Birmingham New Street.
There are plenty of trains going there. What day and time would you like to travel?
I would like to leave on Sunday afternoon after 15:00.
I have a train leaving Cambridge at 15:01, and arriving on Birmingham new street at 17:44.
