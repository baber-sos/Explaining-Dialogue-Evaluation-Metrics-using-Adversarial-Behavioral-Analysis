Hi! I'm looking for a place to stay with 3 stars that includes wifi.
I can help you with that. I have several options that fit this criteria. Do you prefer a particular area of town?
Just near Cambridge , and should be a guesthouse.
Bridge guest house is a guesthouse in the south in the moderate price range with free wifi and parking. Would you like to reserve a room?
Certainly. There will be 5 of us for 4 nights starting on Tuesday.
I was able to book for 5 people for 4 nights starting on Tuesday. The reference number is 97VS1TDE . Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes, I need a train for the same day. I need to leave after 16:30.
Where are you leaving and arriving from?
I'm coming to Cambridge from London Kings Cross.
Train TR1434 leaves at 17:17 and arrives at 18:08, it is a 51 minute ride. Do you want me to book you?
No thanks, I'm just looking for information. That's everything I need for now.
I understand. Have a very nice day.
