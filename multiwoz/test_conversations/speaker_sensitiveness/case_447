I'm looking for an attraction to visit. Is there anything located in the west part of town?
There are 13 attractions in the west part of town. Would you like to visit a college?
No, I was thinking of something fun to do. Do you have any suggestions?
I have several museums to choose from. I also have an entertainment attraction called Whale of a Time. Can I interest you in one of those?
Whale of a Time sounds like a whale of a time! Yes, can I have their phone number, address, and postcode please?
