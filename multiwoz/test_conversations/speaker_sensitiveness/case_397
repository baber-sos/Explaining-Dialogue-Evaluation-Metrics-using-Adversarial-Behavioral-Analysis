I am looking for a train to Cambridge on Saturday.
certainly, do you know from where you will be departing, and at what time?
I will depart at Birmingham New Street and should arrive by 11:30. Can you help me with this?
Of course I can. There are 6 possibilities, at what time would you like to leave?
