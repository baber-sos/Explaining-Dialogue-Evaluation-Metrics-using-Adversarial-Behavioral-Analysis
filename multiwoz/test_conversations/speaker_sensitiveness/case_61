Hi, I'm looking for a place to stay that has free wifi and free parking.
Do you have a preference for area or price range?
I do not have a preference but I do want a hotel not a guest house.
There are 8 such hotels. I recommend gonville hotel. Would you like me to book you a room?
Sure. That would be great.
How many people will be in your party and how long would you like to stay?
There are 3 of us and we'll be arriving on Saturday.
And for how many days?
It will be for two nights.
I'm sorry but there is no availability for 2 nights starting on Saturday. Is there another day that works for you? Perhaps a different hotel?
Can you try for just 1 night then?
Sure, you're booked for one night. The reference number is AJUGHITG . May I help with anything else?
No. That'll be all, thanks. Bye!
You're welcome. Thanks for contacting the Cambridge TownInfo Centre and have a great day!
