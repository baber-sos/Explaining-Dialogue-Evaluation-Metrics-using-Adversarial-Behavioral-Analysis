Please find a restaurant in the north that serves unusual food.
I apologize, we don't have any restaurants that serve unusual food in the north.
No thank you that will be all
Can I help you find a different type of food?
How about a Chinese restaurant?
There are three Chinese food restaurants in the north side of town. Two are expensive and the other is moderately priced. Do you need more information?
Can you recommend one of those?
I'd recommend the Hotpot. Would you like a reservation or more information?
