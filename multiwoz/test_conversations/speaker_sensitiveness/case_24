I need a place to stay for my trip to cambridge in the east area.
There are 7 great places to choose from. Are you looking for a guesthouse or hotel?
I don't care about the type as long as it is in the east and has free parking.
I'd recommend the Autumn House. Would you like to make a booking?
Yes please. I need the reservation to be for 8 people and 2 nights starting on Tuesday.
Great. I successfully booked your stay. Your reference number is 2OVWNFW1 . Is there anything else I can help you with?
