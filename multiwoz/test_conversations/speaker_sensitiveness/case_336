I'm looking to check out local colleges can you help me?
Sure thing! There are several, do you know the area?
I'm not particular on the area, do you have a recommendation?
Christ's College is in the centre and has no entrance fee. Their phone number is 01223334900, they are located on saint andrew's street, post code cb23bu. Anything else?
I'm looking for an indonesian restaurant in the north.
I'm afraid we don't have any Indonesian restaurants. Is there something else that might work instead?
Well how about one that serves indian food then?
Would you like a restaurant in the moderate or cheap price range?
It doesn't matter, I'd like to book it for 8 people on Thursday at 14:15.
Both restaurants are booked at that time. Will another time work for you?
Yes, try 13:15, please.
I have booked you for 8 people at 14:15 on thursday at the nirala. The address is Victoria Avenue Chesterton. Phone number 01733553355. Anything else?
Can I get the reference number?
I Am sorry, it is not open then. Is there another time or place I can book you during?
I don't understand, did you book the reservation or not?
