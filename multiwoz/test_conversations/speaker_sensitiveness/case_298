I'm currently planning my trip to Cambridge, but need some help finding a certain restaurant.
Sure, I can help you with that. What type of cuisine are you looking for?
Actually, I'm looking for some info on Kymmoy restaurant. Can you tell me about them?
Absolutely! They are a great asian oriental restaurant in the centre of town. They are on the expensive side. Would you like help in reserving a table?
I need their address, and postcode.
They are at 52 Mill Road City Centre, postcode cb12as
