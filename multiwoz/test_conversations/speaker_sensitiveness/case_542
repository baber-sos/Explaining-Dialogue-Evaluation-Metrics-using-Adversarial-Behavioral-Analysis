Are there any places in the east of town that are recommended to go to? Thanks.
Yes, several. The Cambridge Museum of Technology is good, or if you're in a more aquatic frame of mind there's the Abbey Pool and Astroturf Pitch. Do they sound appealing?
I need the postcode please.
The postcode for the museum is cb58ld.
Can you book tickets for me?
I'm sorry, our service can't book museums but their phone is 01223368650.
Okay thankyou. I'd llike to find a 4 star hotel with wifi.
Do you have a price range in mind?
Nope. Pick a hotel you think I would like too.
What area should it be in?
I'd like it to be the same area as the attraction.
Carolina bed and breakfast is a great moderately priced guesthouse. Would you like me to make a reservation for you?
Yes. I need it booked for Saturday. 3 people, 4 nights. I'll also need the reference number.
You are booked, the reference number is WK64YQ5Y, can I help with anything else?
