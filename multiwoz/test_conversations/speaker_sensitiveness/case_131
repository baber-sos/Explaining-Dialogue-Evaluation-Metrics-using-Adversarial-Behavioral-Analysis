I'm looking for an expensive place to eat in the centre.
There are a lot of great, expensive restaurant in the centre. What type of food would you prefer?
It doesn't matter to me which type of food they serve. What would you recommend for a person eating alone?
How about Midsummer House Restaurant, serving British food? It's at Midsummer Common. Would you like to book a table?
