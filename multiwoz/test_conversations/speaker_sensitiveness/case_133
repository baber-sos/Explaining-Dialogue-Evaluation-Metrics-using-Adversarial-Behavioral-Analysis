I am looking for a train that leaves Sunday and heading to London Liverpool Street.
Wonderful, I can help you. What time on Sunday would you like to depart?
Depart time does not matter but I need it to arrive at 18:00.
The TR2141 arrives by 15:27. Would you like me to reserve some seats for you?
Yes, for one please.
Okay, you're all set. The fee is 13.28 GBP and your reference number is NN0DDVK4 .
Excellent. I also am looking for a restaurant as well. It's called the sitar tandoori.
I found 4 restaurants with the name Tandoori that serve Indian food on the South, West, and East. Do you have a location preference?
No, any location is fine.
Okay, one moment while I make your reservation at Tandoori on the East side.
Please make sure you reserve my table for 13:30 on the same day and I'll need a reference number.
I apologize, there are no openings available for Sunday at 1:30.
No problem, can you please try 12:30?
Your table has been reserved. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Can I have the reference number.
Of course. Your reference number is WX660X0M . Can I help you with anything else today?
