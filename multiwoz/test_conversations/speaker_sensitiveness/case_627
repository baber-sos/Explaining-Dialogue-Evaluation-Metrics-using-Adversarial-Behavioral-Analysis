I am looking for a restaurant that serves mediterranean food.
There are three, expensive, one cheap. Which would you prefer?
Can you give me the info on the cheap one? I'd like to book a reservation, if necessary, at 11 am on Wednesday for 5 people.
The Gardenia is located at 2 Rose Crescent City Centre. I have booked your table at this restaurant for five people, Wednesday at 11 am. Your reference number is DU8IWQZ2 .
