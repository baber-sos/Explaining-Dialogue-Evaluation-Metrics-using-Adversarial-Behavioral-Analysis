I am coming to Cambridge and would like to see some architecture. Do you have any located in the centre?
Yes, there are 5 places located in the centre. I recommend the All Saints Church on Jesus Lane.
Thanks! What's the entrance fee?
There is no entrance fee, it is free. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I'd like to find a guesthouse to stay at. I want it to be nice, so I'd like an expensive one.
It seems like all of my guesthouses are in different price ranges. No expensive ones are listed. Can I interest you in a different price range?
Well then I need a hotel that has free parking and a 4 star rating.
I've found three hotels matching your preferences. The University Arms Hotel is in the expensive price range and is located in the centre of town if you are interested.
I would like a guesthouse in the moderate price range that has 4 stars and includes free parking.
I have 9 total guesthouses that meet your needs. They are located in the north, east, and south. Do you have a preference?
Can you recommend one?
acorn guest house seems like a nice place because it is the first one on my list how about that one its probably not too shabby
OK, that one sounds great!
Would you like me to book it for you?
Yes, book it for 5 people for 4 nights starting Thursday.
Unfortunately the booking was not successful.
What if we try two nights?
Your booking was successful with a reference number of VZRQHFHP . Can I help you with anything else?
Thanks great. Also I need to have the phone number for All Saints Church on Jesus Lane.
