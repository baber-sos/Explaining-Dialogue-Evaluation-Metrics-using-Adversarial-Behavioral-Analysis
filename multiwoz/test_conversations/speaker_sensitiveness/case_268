Hi, I'd like to find a train from Cambridge to Leicester.
Certainly, there are many trains going that route. Can you specify which day you'd like to travel?
I would like to travel on Saturday.
I've got a full schedule of trains going that route on Saturday. Do you have a preferred time to leave or get there?
