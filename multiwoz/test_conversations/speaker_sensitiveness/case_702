I'm looking to find an expensive italian restaurant.
There are 5 expensive italian restaurants, would you like one in the south or centre?
i would liek one in the centre
There are four in the centre- stazione restaurant and coffee bar, clowns cafe, don pasquale pizzeria, and cafe uno. Can I book one of those for you?
Yes, I'd like to try the Don Pasquale Pizzeria. Could you book a table for 5, at 19:30 on Saturday?
It is booked here is your ref number C1AFQ9DD is there anything else you need?
I also need a train from Broxbourne to Cambridge, arriving by 10:15.
