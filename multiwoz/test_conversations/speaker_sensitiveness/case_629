Hi. Can you help me find a restaurant?
Yes, there are a lot of available restaurants. May I help you narrow down your choices?
I'm looking in particular for the Mahal of Cambridge.
Mahal of Cambridge is located at 3-5 Millers Yard Mill Lane. Would you like me to book a reservation for you?
Yes, please reserve a table for thursday.
Sure, how many will be in your party and what time would you like to dine?
There will be 4 in my party and we would like to book for 13:15.
Got it! Your table will be held for 15 minutes. Your reference number is: CJU3R6KZ . Is there anything else I can help you with?
