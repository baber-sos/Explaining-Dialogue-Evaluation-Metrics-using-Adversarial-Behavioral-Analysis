Hi, can you find me a train going to birmingham new street that leaves after 16:45?
What day would you like to go and where will you be departing from?
I would like to leave cambridge on Wednesday.
There a few trains that will get you there. TR1766 departs at 18:01 and arrives at 20:44. Does that work for you?
Yes that works. Please book it for 6 people.
I booked your seats for 6 people on TR1766 departing Cambridge on Wednesday at 19:01. The total comes to 450.6GBP and your reference number is 8WMYBHC3 .
Great! Now I am looking for a hotel called Finches bed and breakfast.
What information would you like on it?
I'd like to know if it has free parking. Also, the hotel type and it's postcode.
Finches bed and breakfast is a guesthouse. It does have free parking. It's post code is cb30nd. Is there anything else I can help you with tonight?
No, that is all the information I need. Thank you for all of your help.
It's been a pleasure. Good day sir. Goodbye.
