I am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should be in the north and should be in the type of guesthouse
There are many results for a guesthouse in the north, what price range are you looking for?
I don't care about the price but it needs to be a four star hotel.
I have 8 options. Guesthouse for all of them. Do you have a price range preference?
I need a place with 4 stars.
Okay, how about the Acorn Guest House?
Do they have internet and what's the price range?
Yes, they have free wifi and it's moderately priced.
