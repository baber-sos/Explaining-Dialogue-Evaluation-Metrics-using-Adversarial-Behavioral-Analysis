I need you to find a hotel so I have a place to stay. It doesn't need to include internet, but it should include free parking.
I like acorn guest house. Need me to book a room?
Can you tell me more about the Acorn guest house before we look at booking. I'm looking for a moderately priced room and some other amenities.
The Acorn has parking and free wifi. It's in the North part of town at 154 Chesterton Rd. It's a 4 star guesthouse.
Do you have anything that has a 3 star rating?
I have 3 guesthouses that are in moderate price range with 3 star ratings, do you have a location preference?
Yes, I would like to stay in the centre please.
I don't have anything in that area. Can I look somewhere else?
I don't have a preference in what area of town.
I can recommend the hamilton house in the north. Would you like to make a booking?
Do they have free wifi, I was really looking for a hotel rather than a guesthouse though.
I am sorry i cannot find any Hotel with a 3 star rating, I only find Guest House's.
A guesthouse will be fine I guess. Can you recommend one?
Hobsons house is a very nice guesthouse, would you like me to book you?
Yes book it for 7 people on 3 nights starting from Friday.
I was able to book it, your reference number is VI3DLQ64 .
Great, can you help with trains, too? All 7 of us need to get there from Stevenage.
What day do you want to depart and what time do you want to leave from stevenage?
I would like to depart sometime after 13:45 on Friday, please.
I have a train leaving at 13:54 with an arrival time of 14:43. If that is acceptable, I would be more than happy to book your tickets for you.
Yes, that works. Can you book 7 tickets please?
Booking was successful, the total fee is 89.6 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : OS6SO15N .
Thank you for all of your help with this.
