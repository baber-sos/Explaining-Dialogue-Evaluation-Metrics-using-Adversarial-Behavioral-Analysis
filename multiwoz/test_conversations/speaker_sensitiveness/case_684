Are there any good places to visit in the centre of town? Thankyou.
There are loads of fun, interesting attractions in city centre. Do you have anything specific in mind? Architecture, boats, concerthalls, museums, colleges, nightclubs, parks, swimmingpools, theatres?
I don't have a preference. Please pick something for me.
