I'm looking for a 2 star guesthouse in Cambridge. I am flexible on date. What would you recommend?
I was unable to find any 2 star rated guesthouses, do you have another preference?
Could you try again? It should be in the north as well.
No I am really sorry something else perhaps?
What about a guesthouse in the north?
I have found quite a number of matches, over 10, unless you have other specifications I would suggest the Worth House.
I really need something 2-stars. If there are no guesthouses that meet that, can you try a hotel please?
