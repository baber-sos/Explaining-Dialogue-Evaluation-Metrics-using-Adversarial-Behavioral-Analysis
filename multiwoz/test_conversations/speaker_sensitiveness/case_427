I am looking for a moderately priced place to dine in the centre of Cambridge
Is there any specific type of food you are wanting?
I would like a polynesian restaurant, please.
Unfortunately there are no Polynesian restaurants located in Cambridge, were you wanting any other type of food?
Are there any Turkish restaurants?
I have 2 Turkish restaurants in the Centre, both are moderately priced. Anatolia and Efes Restaurant, would you like to book at either one of them?
Could you tell me more about their locations? Do they offer free parking? How far are each of them from my hotel?
One is at 30 Bridge Street City Centre, and the other is at King Street City Centre
Please book the one at 30 Bridge Street. Can you also give me the postcode and phone number?
That would be the anatolia restaurant. The postcode is cb21uj, phone 01223362372. How many are in your party and what day would you like the reservation?
I'll be dining Saturday at 7 pm, there are 3 in my party. Also, I need to know if there are any trains leaving Sunday going to Peterborough.
