Hi I am looking for a restaurant in the centre of town serving north indian food.
We don't have any specific restaurants in that category. Let's try something else?
That's too bad. How about Chinese?
Okay sure what do you have?
Okay when you find something I would like to make a reservation for 2 people on a Sunday at 13:30.
Do you have a price range in mind?
I don't mind about the price range.
Okay, how about lan hong house? It is a chinese restsurant in the centre area and is in the moderate price range. Will that work for you?
That's fine. Can you try booking it?
I'm sorry, but I wasn't able to book the restaurant for that date and time. Would you like to try a different time?
How about 12:30?
You are booked for 12:30 on Sunday for 2 people. Your reference number is F1NTKWZO . Is there something else I can help you with?
