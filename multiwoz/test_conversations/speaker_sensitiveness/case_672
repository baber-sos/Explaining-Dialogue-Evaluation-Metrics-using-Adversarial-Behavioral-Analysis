I need a train to Cambridge and I need it to leave after 12:45.
There are 833 trains that meet your needs. Would you like to narrow it down by departure station and/or day of travel?
I'm leaving from peterborough and need to travel on tuesday.
That narrows it down to 23 choices. What time were you wishing to arrive?
