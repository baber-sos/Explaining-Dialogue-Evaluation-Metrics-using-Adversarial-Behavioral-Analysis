Hey I'm trying to find a train that leaves on monday to Kings Lynn.
Are you departing from Cambridge?
Yes. I am departing from Cambridge.
I found 19 trains running between those 2 stations that day. Would you like to leave at a certain time?
No but I need to arrive by 17:00.
I have train TR7964 leaving at 5:11 and arriving at 5:58.
How much travel time is involved with this train? I also need a Mexican restaurant in the expensive range.
I can process one request at a time. The train is about an hour.
I need the exact travel time please.
The exact time is 47 minutes. Would you like to book this train?
Thanks, I don't need to book a train just yet. Can you just help me find a high-end Mexican restaurant?
Chiquito restaurant bar is in the south of town. It is expensive. The address is 2G Cambridge Leisure Park Cherry Hinton Road Cherry Hinton, phone 01223400170. Would you like reservations?
Can I get a table for 1, please? I know it sounds sad, but I just don't have any friends to travel with.
It doesn't sound sad at all! Can you tell me what time and day you'd like the reservation for?
Sure it'll be 13:30.
