I am looking to get on a train that departs from Ely on Thursday
There are 10 results of trains departing from Ely on Thursday. All are destined for Cambridge. Do you have any specific times that you would like me to look up?
The train should leave at 18:45
There's a train at 19:35 arriving Cambridge at 19:52. Would you like me to book it for you?
Is there any train leaving sooner?
No, there is not.
Okay go ahead and book the one for 19:35. I also need a hotel on the cheap side.
How many tickets will you be needing for the train?
just 1
Okay I have booked your train. What part of town would you like to stay in?
