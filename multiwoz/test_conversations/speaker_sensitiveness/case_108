I have a train scheduled to depart Peterborough at 14:19 and will arrive in Cambridge by 14:38. Would you me like to book this for you?
Yes, for 2 people, please.
Okay all booked! The arrival time is actually 15:09 and your reference number is YENH8FDC .
Thanks! I'm also looking for a chinese place located in the centre?
There are 10 that match your preference. Do you have a price range? Or do you know the name of the restaurant?
I would like a restaurant in the cheap price range. Can you find one?
There are three Chinese restaurants in the Centre that are in the cheap price range: Charlie Chan, Rice House, and Golden House. Do you have a preference?
