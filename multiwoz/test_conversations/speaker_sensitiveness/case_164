Hi! I'd like to find a restaurant located in the centre please.
There are 69 restaurants in the centre- did you have a preferred cuisine type?
Modern European, please, and I'd like someplace moderately priced.
There are two restaurants that fit your criteria which are de luca cucina and bar and riverside brasserie. Which one do you prefer?
You pick and book me on Wednesday. 7 people at 19:30.
I choose de luca cucina and bar. Your reference is WQOYZ16I . How else can I assist? Thanks!
I would also like to see somewhere fun to go in the centre of town.
There are many fun things to do in the centre. Do you know what type of attraction you would like?
I would like to visit an entertainment attraction
I'm sorry, there are no entertainment attractions in the centre of town. Is there anything else i can assist you with today?
Can you search for a boat attraction instead then? And provide the phone number for me please.
There are two. Scudamores Punting Co, located at Granta Place, Mill Lane, and The Cambridge Punter, at 251a Chesterton Road. Which would you prefer?
I prefer the Cambridge Punter. Could you also give me the phone number to The Cambridge Punter also?
The phone number for The Cambridge Punter is 07807718591. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I need a cab too please, arriving by my booked time, car type and contact number would be helpful too please.
You need a cab to get you to the restaurant before the booked time and where do you need cab to pick you up at?
From the Cambridge Punter, please.
