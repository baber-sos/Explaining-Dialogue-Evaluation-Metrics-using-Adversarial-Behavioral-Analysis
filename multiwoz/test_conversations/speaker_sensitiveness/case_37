I want to go to a museum please.
There are many in Cambridge. Could we narrow it down by choosing a specific area of town to search in?
Area does not matter can you recommend one?
How about People's Portraits Exhibition at Girton College in west?
That sounds good, can I have the phone number please?
The phone number is 01223338901. Is there anything else i can help you with?
I also need a train leaving after 18:15 and should leave on tuesday.
