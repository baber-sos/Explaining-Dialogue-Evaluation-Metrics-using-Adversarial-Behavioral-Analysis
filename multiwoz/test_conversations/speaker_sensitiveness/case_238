I am looking for a cheap restaurant in the centre.
I have found many possibilities. Golden house is chinese and the river bar steakhouse and grill serves modern european. Are either of those of interest for you?
Yes, may I have the address, postcode, and phone number for Golden House? I'll book it myself.
They are located at 12 Lensfield Road City Centre, postcode cb21eg, and phone number 01842753771.
Thanks, that's all I need. Have a nice day.
