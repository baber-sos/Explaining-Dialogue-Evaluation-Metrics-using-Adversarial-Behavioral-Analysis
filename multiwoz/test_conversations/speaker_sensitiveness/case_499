I am looking for information in Cambridge
I can definitely help you. Are you interesting in lodging, transportation, entertainment or perhaps some place to eat?
Can you tell me about an attraction called Primavera?
Primavera is a free museum in the centre, their address is 10 king s parade. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
I'm also looking for information on trains departing from cambridge on thursday.
