Where is a 4 star hotel located in North Cambridge?
I have several options, almost all of which are moderate guesthouses. I do have one cheap one, too. Would you like to book a room?
Sure , that could be nice
OK, how many are in your party, what day will you arrive, and how many nights will you be staying?
I actually don't need reservations I just need the phone number, price range.
As I mentioned it is cherap and the phone number is 01223316074.
Okay. now could you help me find a restaurant in the expensive price range that is in the same area as the hotel?
Sure thing what kind of food do you want?
Before we do that, what is the name of the guesthouse? And also, do they have free parking?
The Worth house is in the cheap price range and they do offer parking. Can I help with anything else?
Could you recommend an expensive restaurant in the same area?
