i'm looking for a place called kambar
Sure, I found it! It's located at 1 Wheeler Street. It's a nightclub in the city's centre and it has a 5 pounds entrance fee.
Please give me their postcode
The postcode for Kambar is CB23QB.
I also need a place to stay, a hotel with free parking and in the center of town.
I have 2 hotels in the expensive price range and 2 guesthouses in the cheap price range. Do you have a preference?
I would prefer a guesthouse
I have two to choose from. May I recommend The Alexander Bed and Breakfast?
