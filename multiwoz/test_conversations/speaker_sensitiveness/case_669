Can you help me find a train? I'll be traveling on Wednesday.
What is your departure point and what time would you like to depart?
Oh, of course. Sorry. I'm leaving out of Leicester and going into Cambridge.
Is there a specific time you want to leave or arrive by? I have 2,828 trains to pick from. I need to narrow this down.
