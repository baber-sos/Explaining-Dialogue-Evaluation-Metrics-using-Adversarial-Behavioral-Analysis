Hi, can you give me some information on a place to stay in Cambridge? I would prefer some place expensive.
Sure, there are 5 expensive hotels in Cambridge. Is there an area you prefer?
No specific area, but I would like a guesthouse, rather than a hotel. I would also like a place that's 3 stars.
There are 2 three star hotels would you like me to book one?
