I am looking for a hotel .
There are a total of 9 hotels . Huntingdon Marriotte Hotel is a good choice with a 4 star rating . Would you like there phone number?
I actually need a place that has free wifi and is in the south part of town . And it needs to be a hotel, not a guesthouse .
The lensfield hotel is the only hotel that matches your criteria . Would you like to book a stay?
I'd just need their star rating and phone number, thank you .
Absolutely! The Lensfield hotel is a 3 star hotel and their phone number is 01 223 355017 . Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes . I need to find a restaurant called The Cow Pizza Kitchen and Bar
That restaurant is located in the centre of town on Corn Exchange Street and their phone number is 01 223 308871 . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
I think you help me with everything I needed Thank you .
I'm glad I could assist you, have a great day!
