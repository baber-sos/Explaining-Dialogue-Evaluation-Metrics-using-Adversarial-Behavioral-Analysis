I am visiting Cambridge and looking for local attractions . Can you suggest a place to go in town?
I'm sure I could . Any particular area or type of attraction you're interested in?
Yes, could you provide me with information on museums in the west of town and the entrance fees?
There are 7 choices . How about Cafe Jello Gallery? It fits your needs and has free admission . Would this work for you?
Perhaps . I'm also looking for a restaurant called Pizza Express Fen Ditton . Can you tell me about that?
Sure, pizza express Fen Ditton's phone number is 01223324033 . Would you like me to make a reservation?
Yes please . I will need a table for 3 people on Sunday at 14:45 . Can I also have the reference number for it when it is booked?
Absolutely . I was able to reserve the table for you; it will be reserved for 15 minutes . The reference number is 0CGNOY9R.
