I am looking for an expensive place to eat.
We have plenty of high end expensive options in Cambridge, 57 to be exact. Anything I can do to narrow down your options?
Are there any Japanese restaurants in the centre of town?
There are not any expensive Japanese restaurants in the centre, but there is a moderately priced one. Would that work for you?
Could you check again for an expensive one?
It is wagamama, would you like a reservation?
Yes I need it Monday at 17:45 for 3 people.
