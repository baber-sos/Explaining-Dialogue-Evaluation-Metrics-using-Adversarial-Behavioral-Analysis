I need a train going to Cambridge that will depart after 10:15 from broxbourne.
I have train TR5678 that would suit you.
Could you just tell me when that one departs?
Train TR5678 departs Broxbourne at 10:32 and arrives at Cambridge at 11:32.
Great can you get me a booking for 3 people?
Booked! Your reference number is: XZU4Z1RR . Can I help with anything else?
Thank you. Yes. I am also looking for an international restaurant.
There are three. Two located in the centre that are moderate in price and one in the east that is cheap.
I want the one in the east, please book me a table for 3 people.
Certainly. Can you please tell me for what day you would like for me to make this reservation?
can you book it for sunday afternoon?
What time exactly would you like to dine?
Actually, I'd like a moderately priced international restaurant in the centre. I need the postcode and address please. Sorry, I keep changing my request!
No problem. How about The Varsity Restaurant located at 35 Saint Andrews Street City Centre with phone number 01223356060? There is also Bloomsbury Restaurant if you prefer.
