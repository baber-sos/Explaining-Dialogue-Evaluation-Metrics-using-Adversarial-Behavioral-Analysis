We would like to visit a museum while we are in town.
Okay, that sounds fun! What area are you going to be in?
We will be in the centre area. What do you suggest? Please provide phone number, postcode, and address.
I have 11 museums in the Centre. I would recommend Castle Galleries, phone number 01223307402, postal code cb23bj, address unit su43, grande arcade, saint andrews street. It is free.
Do you have any other suggestions?
You should check out Primavera. The phone number is 01223357708. It is at 10 King's Parade and the postcode is cb21sj.
