I want to find a place to go in the centre to enjoy some entertainment. Can you help?
There are many attraction types in the city centre, did you have one in mind?
Yes, I'm looking for something with the type of architecture. Thanks!
I would recommend All Saint's Church as a great place to see interesting architecture.
