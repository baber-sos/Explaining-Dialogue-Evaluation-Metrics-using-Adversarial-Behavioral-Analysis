I am looking for an expensive place to eat .
We have plenty of high end expensive options in Cambridge, 57 to be exact . Anything I can do to narrow down your options?
Are there any Japanese restaurants in the centre of town?
There are not any expensive Japanese restaurants in the centre, but there is a moderately priced one . Would that work for you?
Could you check again for an expensive one?
It is wagamama, would you like a reservation?
Yes I need it Monday at 17:45 for 3 people .
Booking was successful . The table will be reserved for 15 minutes . Reference number is: D77JCGJ2 .
Thanks . I'm also looking for hobsons house . Do you know where it is?
Yes, that's a great guesthouse in the West . It's address is 96 barton road
