Hi I am looking for a restaurant in the centre of town serving north indian food .
We don't have any specific restaurants in that category . Let's try something else?
That's too bad . How about Chinese?
Okay sure what do you have?
Okay when you find something I would like to make a reservation for 2 people on a Sunday at 13:30 .
Do you have a price range in mind?
