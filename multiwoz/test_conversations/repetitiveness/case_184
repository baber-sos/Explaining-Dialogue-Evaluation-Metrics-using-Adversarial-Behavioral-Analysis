Hi, can you help me plan my Cambridge trip? I need a train from London Kings Cross to Cambridge .
I can help you with that . One leaves friday at 05:17, is that time okay for you?
Actually, I need to leave Tuesday after 10:30 .
I have a train that leaves Tuesday at 11:17 that will arrive at 12:08 . Would you like to make a reservation?
Yes, please make a reservation for 6 people . I'll need the reference number .
I was able to book your train . Your reference number is F13RS8CP . Is there anything else that you need?
I'm also looking for a place to eat . I would like an expensive south indian restaurant .
It looks like we don't have any of those . Would you like to try something else?
Hmm, are you sure? I want something south indian, expensive and in the centre of town .
I have curry garden for Indian in the centre of town, but no south indian .
What about one that serves mediterranean?
I have two options . I can recommend la mimosa . Would you like me to reserve a table?
You said you have two options . What is the other option available?
Other than the La Mimosa Restaurant, I also have the Shiraz Restaurant . Both are located in the center and are expensive . Which do you prefer?
Lets go with the Shiraz please
Ok perfect, would you like me to book a reservation for you?
No . I think I am ok although I would like the postcode .
The postcode is cb21dp . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
No, that is all . Thank you so much .
Let me know if you need anything else .
I don't need anything else . You were a great help . Goodbye!
