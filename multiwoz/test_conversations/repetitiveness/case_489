Hi, I'd like to find some place to go in the east. What's good to visit?
There are several places would you like an entertainment attraction or a museum?
Can't you suggest something please? I need the address, attraction type and postcode when you find it please.
How about Cambridge Artworks? It's a museum on the east side of town, and they have no entrance fee.
That sounds great. What's their address and postcode?
