Hi, I'm looking for places to go in Cambridge . Preferably a museum in the centre of town .
You could check out the cambridge contemporary art museum on 6 trinity street .
That sounds nice . Can you give me their phone number please?
Certainly, it is 01223324222 . Anything else I can help you with?
Yes, I'm interested in a hotel called rosa's bed and breakfast . Can you tell me about that?
Yes, rosa's bed and breakfast is a guesthouse located in the south part of town in the cheap price range . It has free parking and internet . Would you like to book?
