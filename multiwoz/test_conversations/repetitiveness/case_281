Well, I am planning a trip and could use some help with a place to stay.
I have 33 choices. Is there a particular area you would like to stay in?
I don't have a particular area. It does need to be moderately priced.
Do you have a parking or internet preference?
Yes, I'd like free parking and free wifi. Thanks!
I have 14 hotels that meet your criteria. I can narrow that down further depending on which part of town you want to stay in.
I would like to to be a guesthouse.
There are 12 guest houses that are moderate pricing and offer both free parking and Internet what part of town do you want
it should be in the town center
I'm afraid there aren't any in the Centre part of town. Would you like to try a different part of town?
