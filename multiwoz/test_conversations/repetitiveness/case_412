Hi, I'd like to find a place to stay that includes free wi-fi .
I have quite a few places that offer wifi, is there is a certain price range you are looking for?
Something cheap would be good .
I have about 10 different places . Do you have a preference on the area of town?
No not really . But I would prefer a hotel and like both free wifi and parking if possible .
The Cambridge belfry is a hotel in the west that is cheap and has both free internet and wifi . Would you like to book this?
That's fine . I'll need it for three nights starting on Sunday .
Unfortunately, that day doesn't work . Can we try booking another day or a shorter stay, perhaps?
