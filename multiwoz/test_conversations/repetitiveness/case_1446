I am traveling to Cambridge and am interested in trying local restaurants and finding a hotel for my stay .
There are many restaurants . Can you please elaborate on what you would like?
I need to find a hotel with a 3 star rating that includes free wifi .
I have 5 options for you, located all over town . Do you have a certain area or price range in mind?
I want chinese food in cheap price range in west side of town . A 3 star hotel that is expensive and includes wifi . Also the hotel address, area, and postcode please .
The Lensfield Hotel fits your request and is in the South . It is located at 53-57 Lensfield Road cb21en . Unfortunately, I couldn't find a cheap chinese restaurant on the west side .
Thanks for your help with the hotel . How about a restaurant in the centre that serves Indian food?
