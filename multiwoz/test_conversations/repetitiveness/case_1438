i need a place to stay
Is there a certain area or price range you had in mind?
I really want to stay with something moderately priced . But, I want it to be 4 star rated if possible .
There are lots of moderately priced four star hotels . Are you interested in a particular part of town?
Maybe a guesthouse with free parking, I have 7 guests and that will be for 2 nights this Monday
We have several such choices in the north, south and east . If you have no preference for location shall I just book one for you?
That would be great .
Carolina bed and breakfast is a moderate price, 4 star guesthouse in the east area with wifi and parking . Will that work?
Yeah, that sounds great . Do they have room for all 7 of us?
I can try to see if we do . Can you provide when you want to stay and for how long?
book it for 7 people and 2 nights starting from monday .
Done! Your reference number is 0C3Z1QKO . Can I help you with anything else?
I am also looking to visit saint john's college, do you know the address and cost to visit?
The entrance fee is 2.50 pounds and the address is saint john's street .
Haha, I'm not familiar with Cambridge . What part of town is that in?
