Hi, I am planning a trip and need some recommendations for a place to stay while I am there .
Can I get an area you would like to stay in?
In Cambridge, I need a cheap guesthouse please
There are 9 cheap guesthouses . Is there a particular part of Cambridge you would like to stay in?
I don't really care . I do want a guesthouse with free WiFi, though .
How about the allenbell guesthouse located in the east . It is a cheap hotel with 4 star rating and free wifi and parking .
Is there one in the moderate price range with free internet?
Yes, there is . How many stars should the hotel be rated for?
Star rating does not matter to me .
Avalon is a moderate price guesthouse on the north side of town . Would you like me to book a room for you?
I don't need to book yet, but I would like the address.
