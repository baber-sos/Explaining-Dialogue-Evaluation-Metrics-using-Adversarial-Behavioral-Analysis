I would like to get some information about colleges to visit?
There is Christ's College, Churchill College, Clare College, Clare Hall, Corpus Christi, Downing College, Emmanuel College, and Huges Hall . Would you like me to list more?
May I please have entrance fees, phone numbers, and post codes?
I'll start out by giving you Christ's College . The phone number is 01223334900, the entrance is free, and the post code is cb23bu . Do you need more than that?
I would like to know the entrance fee .
It is free to enter the Christ's college . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
I also need a train leaving on Friday . I will be departing from Birmingham New Street and going to Cambridge . I would like to arrive by 16:30.
