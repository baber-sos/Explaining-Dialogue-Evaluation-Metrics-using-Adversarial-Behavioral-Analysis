I'm looking for a restaurant that serves canapes food . Expensive range should do it .
Unfortunately there are no canapes restaurants .
hmmm . Can you check again? it should be in the centre .
I am sorry but there are no restaurants that fit that criteria in the centre .
Could you try a restaurant that serves british food instead?
