I'm looking for a place to dine on the south side of town . Please find a place that's in the expensive price range .
I found five expensive restaurants on the south side of town . Would you prefer Chinese, Indian, Italian or Mexican?
Do you have a favorite you could recommend? I will need the phone and postcode and food type also please.
