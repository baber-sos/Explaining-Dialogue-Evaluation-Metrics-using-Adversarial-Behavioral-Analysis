I'm looking for something fun to do on the east side of town.
Funky Fun House is my favorite place on the east side! I don't have any information on the entrance fee, but their phone is 01223304705.
Can you please give me the address?
Yes their address is 8 mercers row, mercers row industrial estate.
Can you book tickets for me?
I can not. It doesn't give me the option to book tickets. Just general Information. Can I help you with anything else?
Yes, I'm also looking for an Indian restaurant in the same area.
Sure, I have both expensive and moderately priced restaurants. Do you have a preference?
Moderately price, please.
Ok, I have two options for you - Curry Prince and Rajmahal. Would you like any more information about either of them?
