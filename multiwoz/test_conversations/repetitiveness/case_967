Hi, can you help me find a Caribbean restaurant to eat at on my upcoming visit?
Oh no! We don't have any Caribbean restaurants at the moment. Is there another type you'd like?
Can you please look for an Italian food restaurant?
We have quite a few Italian restaurants. Is there a particular part of the city in which you would like to dine?
