I'd like to take a train from Cambridge on Sunday. Can you please show me the times?
What is your destination?
I am going to london kings cross, and would like to arrive by 15:15.
TR7447 will get you there by 13:51. Do you need some seats booked?
Yes. Can you please book 2 seats?
Your booking was successful. Your total fee is 37.76 payable at the station. Your reference number is JVHB4V3C . Is there anything else we can do to assist you?
I am also looking for a restaurant in the centre of town. I'd like it to be moderate price range, please.
There are many wonderful restaurants in the centre, do you have a cuisine in mind?
Not really, pick something tasty for us and book a table, please! 11:15 on that same day, same group.
I booked you a table at ali baba, a lebanese restaurant. Your reference number is 8V419UNN . Do you need anything else?
