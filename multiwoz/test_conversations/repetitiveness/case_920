Hello, I'd like some information on a restaurant today .
There are many options in Cambridge, do you have any tastes in particular?
I would like some British food .
There are 11 results for british restaurants . Is there a certain area or price range you're looking at?
I want something in the west area with a moderate price .
Saint Johns Chop House fits your request perfectly . They are located at 21-24 Northampton Street . Would you like to make a booking?
No thank you, but may I please have the phone number, address, and post code?
