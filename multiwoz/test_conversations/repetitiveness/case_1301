I am looking for a chinese restaurant in the centre of town.
Sure, there are 10 Chinese restaurants in the centre of town, do you have a price range in mind?
It doesn't matter. Can you pick one and give me the postcode and the price range, please.
Sure, the charlie chan is good, the price range is cheap and postcode is cb21db.
Can you recommend an attraction that is also in the town centre?
Certainly. You might enjoy All Saints Church. It's famous for its architecture, and free to visit.
That sounds great! Could you send me the phone number, postcode, and attraction type?
All Saints Church is famous for its architecture. It's located on Jesus Lane, CB58BS. They can be reached at 01223452587. Is there anything else I can find for you?
