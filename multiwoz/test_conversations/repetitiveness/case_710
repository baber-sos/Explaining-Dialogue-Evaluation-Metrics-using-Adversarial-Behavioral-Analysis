I want to find a train leaving Cambridge and going to Bishops Stortford . Can you help me?
Yes I can what time are you wanting to leave by?
We need it to leave after 17:00 on Sunday .
I have train TR6742 that leaves at 17:29 and will have you in Bishops Stortford by 18:07 . Will that work for you?
Yes could you book one ticket for me and give me the reference number?
