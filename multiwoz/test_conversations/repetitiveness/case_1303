I need a train to arrive in cambridge by 19:30 on thursday.
We should be able to help you, where will you be coming from?
The train should go to london kings cross and should depart from cambridge at 19:30
If you are indeed traveling from Cambridge to Kings Cross, I recommend TR1791. It will arrive in Kings Cross at 17:51 on Thursday.
I need 2 tickets please and the reference number can you help me with that?
I was able to book it, reference number is UT2T6SJ1 .
I am also looking for a restaurant in the center of town in the expensive price range.
Okay, and what type of food would you like to eat?
Any type of cuisine is fine with me. Can you book a table for us at your favorite? We'll need it at 11:30, before we take that train.
