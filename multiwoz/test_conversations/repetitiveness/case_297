Hello, I need to find a hotel with free wifi and free parking. Can you help me?
There are 29 places with free internet and parking. Do you have an area, price, star, or hotel type preference?
Can you find me a guesthouse that is expensive?
Unfortunately, I don't happen to have any guesthouses that are in the expensive range. Can I look in another price range perhaps?
