I am staying in the centre of town for the weekend, what is there to do there?
We have several things to do! Architecture, colleges, museums...What type of attraction are you most interested in?
It doesn't matter but can you recommend one and give me the entrance fee?
I recommend castle galleries and it's free to get in!
