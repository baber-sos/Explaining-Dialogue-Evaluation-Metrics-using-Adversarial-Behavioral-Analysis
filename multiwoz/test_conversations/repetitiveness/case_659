Hi, can you please give me information on a restaurant called Midsummer House Restaurant located in Cambridge?
This is a British restaurant found in the center of town that is in the expensive price range. What other information do you need?
Can you book this restaurant for 3 people on Wednesday at 15:45?
I booked it for you- the reference number is 5CWU2U98 . Is there anything else?
I would like to do a little site seeing. Do you have any good attractions in the east?
There are many in the east,what type are you most interested in?
are there museums?
May I suggest Cambridge Artworks? It sounds like just what you are looking for and is Free to visit.
