I am looking for a mexican restaurant in the centre.
I'm sorry, there aren't any Mexican restaurants in the centre of town. Would you like to try a different cuisine?
How about an Indian restaurant then?
There is the curry garden which serves indian food in the centre. Would you like to make a booking?
Oh, no, but I do need the postcode address and number.
Curry Garden's phone number is 01223302330. They are located at 106 Regent Street City Centre. The postcode is cb21dp. Would you like me to book you a table?
