Do you know of any 3 star hotels to stay in?
Yes, there are 6 I can recommend to you. Do you have other specifications, or shall I select one for you?
I would like for the hotel to be located in the south and include free wifi.
I have two different choices. One is rather expensive and the other more moderately priced. Do you prefer one over the other?
Either is fine. Can you see if one of them might have a room on Wednesday for 3 people and 3 nights?
Ok. I have booked the lensfield hotel for you. The reference number is 11XDM9CC .
Can I have the address and phone number please?
Of course. The address is 53-57 Lensfield road. Phone number is 01223355017.
