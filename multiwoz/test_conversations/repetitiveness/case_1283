I'm looking for a restaurant in the centre..
There are over 60 restaurants to choose from in the centre. Is there a type of food you are interested in?
I'd like for it to be expensive. Any you choose is fine. I'll need the postcode, also, please.
Kymmoy meets your criteria. It serves Asian Oriental food. The postcode is cb12as.
Great, thanks. I'm also looking for an attraction called the sheep's green and lammas land park fen causeway.
