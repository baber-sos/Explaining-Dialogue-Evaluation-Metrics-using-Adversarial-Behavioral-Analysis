Hi! Are there any asian oriental restaurants in the center of town?
I have 4 different options for you. Did you prefer a certain price range?
Something moderately priced would be great.
The yippee noodle bar is an asian oriental restraunt in the town centre with a moderate price. Would you like to make a booking?
Yes I need a table for 4 on Saturday.
What time shall we make that booking for?
16:30 please.
Okay, I successfully booked that table for you at 1630 for your party. Please arrive on time, as the table is only reserved for 15 minutes.Your reference number is LSAY2YOX .
Thank you. I think that's everything I need.
You're welcome! Have a nice day.
