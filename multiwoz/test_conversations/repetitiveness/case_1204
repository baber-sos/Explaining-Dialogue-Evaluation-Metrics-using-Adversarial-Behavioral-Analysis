I am looking for suggestions for a cheaper restaurant in the center of town .
I have several listings available for you to choose from, is there any preference on the type of food they serve for you?
Not really . Just get me a table for 3 on Tuesday at 17:00
Would you like me to book you a table at Dojo Noodle Bar at 40210 Millers Yard City Centre for Tuesday at 17:00 for 3 people?
Yes please, if that time doesn't work, we can try for 16:00 .
Your booking for 3 at the Dojo Noodle Bar for Tuesday at 16:00 . Your reference number is V65S4LW2 .
I also need a hotel with free parking and free wifi .
What area of town and price range would you prefer?
I prefer a guesthouse, and I need someplace cheap, please . Area doesn't matter .
I have several options here . I would recommend Finches Bed and Breakfast thats located in the west . Would you like more info or would you prefer something different?
