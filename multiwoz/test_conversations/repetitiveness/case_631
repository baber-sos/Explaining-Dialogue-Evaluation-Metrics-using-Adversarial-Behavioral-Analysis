Can you help me find a train leaving thursday departing from london liverpool street?
I have 10 trains leaving at this day and time with Cambridge as the destination. What will your approximate departure time be?
I don't have a preference but I do need to be in Cambridge by 15:00.
the TR1268 will get you there by 13:07, how many tickets?
What is the price of the ticket and departure time?
The departure time is 11:39 and the cost will be 16.60 pounds.
Thanks. I also need to find a guesthouse with free wifi.
I can also assist you with finding a guest house. Does the train fit your needs and would you like to book tickets for that?
No tickets for the train. I would like a guesthouse in the east that is expensive, please.
I do not have any expensive guesthouses in the east offering free wifi.
How about in the cheap price range instead?
I have the allenbell located at 517a coldham lane. Would you like reservations?
