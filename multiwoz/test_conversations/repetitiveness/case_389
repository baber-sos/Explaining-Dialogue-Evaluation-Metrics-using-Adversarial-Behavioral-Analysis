I'm looking for a jamaican restaurant in the east.
There are no jamaican restaurants in the east. Would you like to try another food type or area?
I'm looking for a place that serves jamaican food in the east. If not, italian will do.
There is one Italian place in the east, Pizza Hut Fen Ditton.
Ok, I'd like to make a reservation there.
I can do that for you, I just need details such as day, time, and the size of your party.
I need a table for 7 at 14:45 on friday.
I booked you a table for 7 on Friday at 14:45 at Pizza Hut Fen Ditton, Reference: 9z2kfxmm . Can I assist you further today?
Yes please, I need a place to stay. Preferably a cheaply priced guesthouse in the same area as the restaurant

That would be great.
okay, what day would you like me to book the reservation for and for how long? How many people should I make it for?
I would like to book it on the same day as the other reservation, for the same amount of people, for 3 nights. Can I have the reference number?
