I am looking for a swimmingpool in town .
There are four public pools, one in the east, two in the north, one in the centre, any preferences?
I just need the address for one of them . I guess the one in the east will do .
Okay abbey pool and astroturf pitch is located on pool way, whitehill road, off newmarket road .
Okay, great . Thank you .
Is there anything else I can help you with today? A train, perhaps?
