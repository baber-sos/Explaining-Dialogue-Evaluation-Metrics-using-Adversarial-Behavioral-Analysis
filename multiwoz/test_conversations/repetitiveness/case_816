Sure! The Slug and Lettuce serves gastropub type food . It's located in the centre and it's expensive . Would you like to book a table?
Absolutely, I need a table for 4 on Thursday, at 11:00 please .
Booking was successful . The table will be reserved for 15 minutes . Reference number is: T7GL0FGT . Is there anything else I can help you with?
Thank you for the reference number . I'm also looking for places to go in the south side of town .
The south side has a lot going on . There's Ceneworld Cinema for movies, the place is a great nightclub and there are some museums in the area as well.
