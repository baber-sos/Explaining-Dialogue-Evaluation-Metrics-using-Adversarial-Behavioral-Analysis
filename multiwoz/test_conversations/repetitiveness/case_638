I'm looking for a moderately priced place to stay .
Certainly, we have many moderately priced options . Which area of town do you prefer to stay in?
I'm not familiar with the different areas, so I guess it doesn't matter . I would like a moderate though . With free WiFi .
The A and B Guest House is in the moderate price range and has free wifi . Would you like to book a room?
Does it have a four star rating? I need free parking, too .
The Archway House would meet your needs . Would you like to make a reservation?
No, could you just tell me the phone number? And what area of town is that in?
The phone number is 01223575314 and it is in the north area of town .
Great! Thanks for all the info . I'm all set . Bye!
