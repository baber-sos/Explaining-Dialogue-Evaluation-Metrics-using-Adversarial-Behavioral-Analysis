I'm looking for places to go in the centre .
Okay! Is there a particular type of place that you would like to visit?
No, surprise me! It should be in the centre .
How about King's College? Would you like more information?
Sure, could you tell me the entrance fee and phone number?
entry is free and phone number is 01223331100. anything else i can be of help?
What is the attraction type?
King's College is a college type attraction . What else can I do for you?
I could really use some help finding info on a guesthouse to stay in . I would need free parking though.
