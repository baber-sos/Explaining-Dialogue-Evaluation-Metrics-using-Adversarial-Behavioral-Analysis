I want something to entertain me in town. What do you have?
I have 5 venues that meet what you asked. Did you have a certain area you wanted?
Nothing in particular. Something with high reviews. Can you send me the address of the top choice?
The Funky Fun House it is. They're located at 8 mercers row, mercers row industrial estate.
Thanks - I am also looking for a european restaurant in the city centre.
I've got eight European restaurants in that area, is there a price range you want to narrow it down to?
