Can you help me find a place to go in the centre?
I can help you with that . Is there a certain kind of attraction that you would like to visit?
Surprise me . Give me the postcode as well .
Would you prefer The Castle Galleries is a museum in the centre of town . Their post code is cb23bj
Great! I'm also looking for a place to eat in the same area . Something not too expensive, but not cheap .
There are 21 places in the centre of town . What type of cuisine would you like?
I am interested in moderately priced international food .
I'd recommend the Varsity Restaurant . Would you like to book a table?
What is the address for your suggested restaurant Varsity?
the varsity restaurant is located at 35 Saint Andrews Street City Centre . Would you like me to book it or more information?
