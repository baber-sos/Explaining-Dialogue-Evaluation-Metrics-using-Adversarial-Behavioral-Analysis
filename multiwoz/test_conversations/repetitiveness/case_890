I am looking for a place to go while in Cambridge . I would like something to do with boats? Do you have that?
There are four different locations related to boating, is there any specific area you're looking to go to?
No there is not, just please provide me with the address of one that you recommend .
The Cambridge Punter, the address is 251a Chesterton Road, post code cb41as . Would you like to know any more info on boats in Cambridge?
I'm looking for a place to stay . I prefer a guesthouse that's expensive .
There are not any expensive guesthouses in Cambridge . Would a moderately priced guesthouse suffice?
