Hi, can you help me find a 4 star place to stay?
There are a total of 21 hotels and guesthouses in the city that have 4 stars. Is there a particular area or price range you would like?
How about a place in the east side of town that is a hotel not a guesthouse
I am sorry but I do not have any hotels in the east. Would you like to change location or type of accomodations?
Yes, can you please change the location to centre?
We have one 4 star hotel that is in the centre, University Arms Hotel, it has internet and parking and is expensive, would this one suit you?
That will be fine. Can you book me a room for Saturday, please?
Certainly. How long would you like to stay, and how many are in your party?
I'll be arriving Saturday and staying 3 nights. There are 3 of us.
Unfortunately, we cannot book you for those days. Could you change the number of days?
Sure, try for two days?
That was unsuccessful too. Wanna try something else?
Is there another one in the Centre with that critera avaible?
No, I'm sorry. I am searching for a 4 star hotel in the centre for 2 nights on Saturday. Is that correct?
I need the hotel for 3 nights starting on Saturday please.
Would you like to change the number of days you are staying. I was unable to find anything.
No, please continue the search.
I'm sorry, but the University Arms does not have anything available on Saturday for 3 people, for a 3 night stay. Would you like to try a different day?
I am so sorry. Could you just change the number of people in my party to 5 and try again?
That worked, I guess you just needed a larger room. Your reference number is PR0ABUBI . Can I be of further assistance?
