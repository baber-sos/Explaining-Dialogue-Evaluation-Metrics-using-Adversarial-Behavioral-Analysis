I'm looking for a restaurant that serves canapes food. Expensive range should do it.
Unfortunately there are no canapes restaurants.
hmmm. Can you check again? it should be in the centre.
I am sorry but there are no restaurants that fit that criteria in the centre.
Could you try a restaurant that serves british food instead?
Yes, we have three British restaurants in the central area. Might I recommend fitzbillies restaurant?
That sounds fine, can you reserve a table for 3 people at 13:00 on Tuesday?
Your table is booked, ref #HHFEEGNF . Can I help you with anything else?
I do need 4 star hotel as well.
great, i have 21 options for you!
I would like it to be in the expensive range too.
Okay we have the huntingdon marriott hotel and the university arms hotel that match your specifications.
Does either have free wifi?
Yes, both have internet.
Great, either one is fine. I need a reservation for 3 people for 3 nights starting Tuesday. If 3 nights is not available try 2 nights and reference number.
