Greetings, are there any moderately priced restaurants in centre?
There are several such restaurants . What type of food are you interested in?
I would like Vietnamese food .
I'm sorry, I don't have a moderately priced vietnamese restaurant . Will anything else do?
What other cuisines are available for a moderate price range in the centre of town?
There are many options available . Some choices are: Asian Oriental, British, Italian, International, Spanish, and Turkish .
Can you suggest one with British cuisine?
There are four restaurants in the centre that serve british food . They are all in the boderate price range . I suggest the copper kettle.
