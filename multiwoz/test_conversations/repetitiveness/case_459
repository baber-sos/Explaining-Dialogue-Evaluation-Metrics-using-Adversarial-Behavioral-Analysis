I am looking for a restaurant in Cambridge called The Missing Sock.
The missing sock is an international restaurant in the east. The address is Finders Corner Newmarket Road. Do you need any further information?
Yes, can you give me a phone number please?
Certainly. Their phone number if 01223812660. Can I help you with anything else?
I am also looking to book a train leaving after 18:30 to go to Kings lynn.
There is a train on friday that leaves at 8:11pm. Does that work?
