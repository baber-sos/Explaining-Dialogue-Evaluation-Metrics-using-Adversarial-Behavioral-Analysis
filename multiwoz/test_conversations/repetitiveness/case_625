I'm looking for a train from Cambridge to London Kings Cross.
When would you like to arrive by?
I would like to arrive by 08:15, and leave on Monday.
I have 2 trains that meet your criteria. One train arrives by 5:51, and the other by 7:51. Would you like to book one of these?
Yes I would like to arrive at 7:51 please for 8 people, I need the reference number
Booking was successful, the total fee is 188.8 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is: 31K4BK2E . Is there anything else you need?
Yes, I am also looking for a multiple sports attraction in the city centre. Are you aware of any?
Unfortunately, there are no multiple sports attractions in the area you specified. Is there some other type of attraction or area I can look into for you?
Alright, that's fine, how about colleges? Are there any of those in the city centre?
