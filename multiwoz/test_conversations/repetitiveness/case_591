I would like to see some type of entertainment while visiting cambridge.
We have five entertainment venues, do you have an area that you want me to search in?
If you could find me a good one, just tell me the area and I need a postcode
Whale of a Time is a great place! It is in the West and the post code is cb238el. Do you need more information?
Yes, I also need a restaurant ina mdoerate range that serve modern european food.
We've got 3 places serving modern european food in town, 2 are in the city centre and one in the south. Do you have a preference?
