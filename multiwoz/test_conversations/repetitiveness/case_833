Greetings, are there any moderately priced restaurants in centre?
There are several such restaurants. What type of food are you interested in?
I would like Vietnamese food.
I'm sorry, I don't have a moderately priced vietnamese restaurant. Will anything else do?
What other cuisines are available for a moderate price range in the centre of town?
There are many options available. Some choices are: Asian Oriental, British, Italian, International, Spanish, and Turkish.
Can you suggest one with British cuisine?
There are four restaurants in the centre that serve british food. They are all in the boderate price range. I suggest the copper kettle.
Great! I would love a reservation for 5 people at 15:00 on Wednesday please.
I was successfully able to book you a table. The reference number is F9UKG65L . Is there anything else?
Thanks, and yes please. I'd also like to find an entertainment attraction in the centre.
there is none in the centre. can we change the location?
Are there any colleges in the area?
There are 13, I recommend trinity college, would you like more info?
Yes. Can I please get the entrance fee and the postcode?
The entrance fee is 1 pound. The postcode is cb21tq. May I help with anything else?
No thanks. That was all. Bye.
I hope your dinner is great.
