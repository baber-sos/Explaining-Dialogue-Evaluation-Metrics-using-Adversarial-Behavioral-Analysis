I am looking for a train to Bishops Stortford. I am departing from Cambridge.
There are 70 trains during the week that go from Cambridge to Bishops Stortford, do you have a day and time you would like to arrive?
Yes, I'd like to leave on Tuesday and arrive by 19:00
How about the TR2771? It arrives at 14:07. Shall I book you a ticket?
Yes, please. I would like 2 tickets on that train, and I will need the reference number.
The train is booked, and the Reference number is P0MVSACW . Total fee is 20.2 GBP payable at the station. Can I help you with anything else?
Can you find me an restaurant near the centre that serves international food?
I have two restaurants in that area. I recommend the varsity restaurant.
