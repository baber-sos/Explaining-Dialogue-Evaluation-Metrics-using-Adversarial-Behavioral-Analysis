Can you help me find a nice restaurant?
Sure! What kind of food do you like?
I was thinking some indian food would be great .
I have 22 indian restaurants- do you have a preference for area of town?
No, I don't care where it is . I'm thinking I'd like an expensive restaurant .
Would you like to try Curry Garden?
That is fine book me a table for 6 on Sat at 17:30 . I also need a train for the same and should leave leicester for cambridge
Alright, I have made your requested booking at curry garden, and the reference number is HK9YCL6Z . As for the train, what time would you like to depart?
