I'm so bored! Can you find me something to do in the centre of town?
If you are into contemporary art, Cambridge Contemporary Art is a great place to relieve boredom . The address is 6 Trinity Street . Best of all, there isn't any entrance fee .
Thank you that sounds great .
Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes, actually . Can I ask for help finding a train for Monday going to Cambridge?
Where would you be departing from?
I'll be leaving from King's Lynn and I need to get to Cambridge by 8:45.
