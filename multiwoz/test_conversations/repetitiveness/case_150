I would like to find some attractions in the west .
What type of attraction would you like to go to?
No specific preference, just need a recommendation
There are 5 colleges, an entertainment attraction and seven museums . They vary in admission price, how much would you like to pay?
I would like you to pick one and tell me the type, fee and the phone number please . Surprise me .
magdalene college has free admission and their phone number is 01223332138
Great, thanks . I am also wanting to find a place to stay . Ugh, I hate guesthouses though so it needs to be a hotel room in the west .
I have two choices in the west . One is in the cheap price range and the other is expensive . Do you have a preference?
