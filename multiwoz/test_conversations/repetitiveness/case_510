Can you help me find a train leaving thursday departing from london liverpool street?
I have 10 trains leaving at this day and time with Cambridge as the destination . What will your approximate departure time be?
I don't have a preference but I do need to be in Cambridge by 15:00 .
the TR1268 will get you there by 13:07, how many tickets?
What is the price of the ticket and departure time?
The departure time is 11:39 and the cost will be 16.60 pounds .
Thanks . I also need to find a guesthouse with free wifi.
