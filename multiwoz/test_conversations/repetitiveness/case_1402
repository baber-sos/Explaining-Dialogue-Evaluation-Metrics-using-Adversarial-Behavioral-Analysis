Can you tell me about any hungarian restaurants in the centre?
I'm sorry I do not have any Hungarian restaurants in Cambridge . Is there another type of cuisine you might be interested in?
How about one that serves modern european food?
We have several in the center, and one in the south . They are in assorted price ranges . Do you have any preferences?
Whatever you recommend, please book me for 5 people at 12:15 on friday .
I have made a booking for De Luca Cucina and bar . The table will be reserved for 15 minutes . Reference number is: 2X1IGK9D .
I also need to find a two star room .
How about the ashley hotel? They are moderately priced and have both internet and parking.
