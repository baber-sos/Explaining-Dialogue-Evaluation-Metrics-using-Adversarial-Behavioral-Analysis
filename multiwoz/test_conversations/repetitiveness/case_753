I need a five starts hotel close to a mall and main restaurants. The hotel should include free wifi in the room.
I'm sorry, but there are no 5-star hotels anywhere in Cambridge. Would you like to broaden your criteria?
How about something with 4 stars and something expensive.
I have 2 options for you - The Huntingdon Marriott on the west side, and the University Arms in the center. Are you interested in one of these?
Maybe. Is either one a 4 star hotel? If so, I'd like to book a room for 4 nights.
Both are 4 stars. How many days would you be staying, and how many people are in your party? I can see if something is available.
