I am looking for a theatre to visit while in Cambridge . Preferably one in the centre of town .
Would you like to try the cambridge arts theatre?
That sounds great! could you tell me how much the entrance fee would cost?
Unfortunately I do not have that information in my system . I could give you their phone number, though, if you like.
