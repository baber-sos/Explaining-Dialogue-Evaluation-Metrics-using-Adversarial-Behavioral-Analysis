I am looking for a cheap place to dine that serves belgian food.
I'm sorry, but there are no belgian restaurants in all of cambridge. Would you like a different type of cuisine?
Let's try Indian food, but it needs to be near the centre of town.
There are no Belgian restaurants in the center of the town. Would you like to try another type of restaurant?
