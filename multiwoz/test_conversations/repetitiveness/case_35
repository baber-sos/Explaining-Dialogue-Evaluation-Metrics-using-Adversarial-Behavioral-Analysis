Can you help me find a place to stay that has a 4 star rating?
I can certainly help you with that. Do you have a preferred price range or area?
Thank you. I am looking for a hotel in the west part of town.
I have 3 in west - two are cheap and one is expensive. Preference on price?
I do not have a preference on price as long as it has a 4 star rating and is a hotel.
I would suggest the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel. It is very nice. Can I get you some information on it?
yeah, can you let me know if it has free parking?
Parking and internet are both included, would you like me to book you?
Yes, please book for 1 person for 4 nights starting from Thursday.
Your booking was successful. Reference number is : 6I8873PA . Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
That's all. Thanks
Thanks so much for visiting! Enjoy your trip!
On second thought, I am looking for a train to Cambridge, leaving Biships Stortford.
