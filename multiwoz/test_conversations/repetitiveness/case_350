I am looking for a restaurant called loch fyne
That is a nice seafood restaurant located on Trumpington Street . Can I reserve a table for you?
Can you tell me a little more about the place? I need to know what type of food they serve, price range and where it's located .
It is an expensive restaurant . They serve seafood and they are located at The Little Rose 37 Trumpington Street .
Great . I also need to know about a hotel called the Hamilton lodge.
