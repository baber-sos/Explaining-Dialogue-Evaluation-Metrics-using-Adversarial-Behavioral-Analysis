I am looking for an expensive place to dine which serves indian food.
Several restaurants fit your criteria. Do you prefer a specific area?
Yes, I am looking to stay in the centre of town.
The top 3 places serving indian cuisine are curry garden, the golden curry, and saffron brasserie. Would you like more options?
