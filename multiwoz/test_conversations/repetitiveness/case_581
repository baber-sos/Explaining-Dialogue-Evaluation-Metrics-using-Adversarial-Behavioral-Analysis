Are there trains arriving in Cambridge before 18:45 on Sunday?
There are many trains that arrive by that time. Where will you be departing from?
I'm leaving Bishops stortford.
I have a train arriving at 16:07 and one arriving at 18:07. Would one of those work?
Can I get the price, travel time, and departure time of the one arriving at 18:07?
The train arriving in Cambridge at 18:07 departs at 17:29. The price of the of the train ride is 8.08 pounds. Would you like to book a train ticket?
Not at this time, but I am also looking for a european food restaurant in the expensive price range. Can you help with that?
There are 5 of those. What area do you want to dine in?
In the centre of town please.
How about eraina? Shall I book you a table?
Yes, please. It will be just me and I'd like to eat at 21:00 on the same day as my train.
OK, I've got your booked. The reference number is VMNDNKV2 and they'll hold your table for 15 minutes. Can I help you with anything else?
