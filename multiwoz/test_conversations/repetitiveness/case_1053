I'd like to find out if there are any cheap portuguese places to eat in Cambridge.
Yes, I have Nandos located in the South and Nandos City Centre located in the Centre. Will one of these work for you?
Yes, I will make a reservation at Nandos in the south part of the city for five people on Thursday.
