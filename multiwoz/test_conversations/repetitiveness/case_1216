Hello, Im looking to book a train from broxbourne to cambridge
What day will you be travelling?
I am leaving on Sunday . I would like to arrive before 20:30 .
The latest train that will arrive before 20:30 would be train TR1428 . It departs at 18:32 and arrives at 19:32 . Would that work for you?
Not right now but can you tell me the travel time for this train?
60 minutes is the travel time
Thank you! I am also looking for a place to stay . I would like a guesthouse that includes free wifi .
I've found 23 guesthouses with wifi . Would you like to further specify your request, for example by price, star rating, or location?
How much is the cheapest place?
I can't tell you specifically how much each place will cost per night, but we have places in cheap, moderate, to expensive price ranges .
Ok, any guesthouse that has free wifi and free parking will be fine . I will need it for 2 nights and 3 people are staying .
What day will you be staying there?
We will be staying there starting Sunday .
I'll be happy to help you book for that day . Can you give me an area of town you prefer so I can book appropriately?
The area doesn't matter, I just need it to be a guesthouse with free wifi and parking . I need a room for 2 nights .
Okay, how many people will be staying?
i need it for 3 people!
I'm sorry, but there are none available on those days . Would you like to try a different day or number of nights?
Ok, how about 1 night?
You're booked at the Acorn Guesthouse for one night on Sunday . The reference number is I6GHMH1K . Can I help with anything else?
No thanks, that's all for today . Thanks again! Bye .
Thank you, and have a nice day!
