i need a place to go and should be a museum
Okay! There are several museums in Cambridge . What part of town would you like to visit?
How about ones in the centre, what's available?
There's 11 different museums in the centre . Would you like a recommendation?
Yes, and if you can tell me it's entrance fee, that'd be great .
The entrance fee is free . is there anything else
