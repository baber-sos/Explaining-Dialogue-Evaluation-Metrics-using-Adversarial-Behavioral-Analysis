I would like to find a theatre in town.
sure, there are 5 options for you
Can you suggest one for me? I would like to know their postcode and entrance fee please.
Sure how about the Cambridge Arts Theatre. It's in the center of town and its postcode is cb23pj, but there is no entrance fee information listed.
