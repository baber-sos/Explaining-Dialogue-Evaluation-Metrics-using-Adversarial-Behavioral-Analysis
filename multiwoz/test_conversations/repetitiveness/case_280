Well, I am planning a trip and could use some help with a place to stay .
I have 33 choices . Is there a particular area you would like to stay in?
I don't have a particular area . It does need to be moderately priced .
Do you have a parking or internet preference?
Yes, I'd like free parking and free wifi . Thanks!
I have 14 hotels that meet your criteria . I can narrow that down further depending on which part of town you want to stay in .
I would like to to be a guesthouse .
There are 12 guest houses that are moderate pricing and offer both free parking and Internet what part of town do you want
it should be in the town center
I'm afraid there aren't any in the Centre part of town . Would you like to try a different part of town?
ok then i will go ahead and take any of the moderately priced ones with free parking and wifi . please recommend one of the 12. any area is fine .
Limehouse is 4 star guesthouse in the north area with free internet and parking .
That sounds good, can you book it for 7 people for 5 nights? We're checking in on Tuesday .
Booking was successful . Reference number is: QF7QDED6 . Is there anything else I can help with?
I also need a train . It should leave Cambridge on Wednes and arrive in London kings cross by 10:15
