I'm looking for some type of entertainment in the centre of town, can you tell me what is available?
Can you be more specific? There's a lot of different things to do, like restaurants, shows, clubs...
Are there any museums?
There are 11 museums in centre, all with free admission. What type of museum would you like to visit?
Any of those museums will work. Will you select one for me? I need their phone number, please.
How about the Fitzwilliam Museum? The phone number there is 01223332900.
That's great. I also need some place to eat someplace moderate that serves corsican food.
I'm sorry, there is nothing meeting those requirements in that area? Would you like me to look further?
Is there any corsica restaurants in the centre of town? Moderate price range
Sorry, there isn't any restaurants that fit that criteria, can I find you something else?
How about one that serves British food then?
The oak bistro is in town centre serving british food and is moderately priced. I'd be happy to make a reservation for you if you'd like?
