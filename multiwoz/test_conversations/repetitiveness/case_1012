Do you know of any 3 star hotels to stay in?
Yes, there are 6 I can recommend to you . Do you have other specifications, or shall I select one for you?
I would like for the hotel to be located in the south and include free wifi .
I have two different choices . One is rather expensive and the other more moderately priced . Do you prefer one over the other?
