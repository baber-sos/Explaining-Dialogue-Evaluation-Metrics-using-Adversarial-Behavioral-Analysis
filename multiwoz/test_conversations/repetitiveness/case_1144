Hi, I'm trying to find a moderate place to eat in the east . Can you help?
I've found a place called curry prince that fits that . Would you like me to place a reservation for you?
Actually I'm more interested in middle Eastern foods .
I have no listings for middle east food, another type maybe?
I think then that Indian place sounds nice, thank you .
Can you tell me the day and time you'd like to eat, and how many people I should book the table for?
Yes . I'll be needing a table for 8 on Sunday at 12:15 .
Booking was successful . The table will be reserved for 15 minutes . Reference number is: APWDPYEL .
Thank you I will take it .
You're welcome . Do you need anything else?
I'm actually also looking for a place to stay . I would like it to be 2 stars and have free wifi .
I have 3 hotels matching your request in the north and east and in the expensive and moderate price range . What part of town and price range would you prefer?
If it narrows it down, can I also have free parking as well?
I have 2 hotels in the moderate price range and one in the expensive price range . Which would you like information on?
I'll go with the expensive one . Can you book me a room for 8 people, 2 nights on Sunday please?
Booking was successful . Reference number is: RR4TKJIH . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
I'll also need a taxi from the hotel to the restaurant .
I would love to do that for you! I just want to confirm you want to arrive at the restaurant at 12:15, correct?
Yes, by 12:15 at the latest .
Alright, I have a yellow Lexus to pick you up from express by holiday inn cambridge and take you to curry prince . It's contact number is 07943663026 . Anything else?
That is everything I needed . Thank you for your help!
