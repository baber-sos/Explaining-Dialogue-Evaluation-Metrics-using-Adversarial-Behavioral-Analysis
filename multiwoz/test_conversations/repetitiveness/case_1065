I am looking for a train that leaves on thursday going to cambridge.
There are 202 trains that meet what you are asking. Where would you like to depart from?
London kings cross, it should also leave after 16:30.
TR1149 departs london kings cross at 17:17 and arrives in cambridge at 18:08. Will that work?
