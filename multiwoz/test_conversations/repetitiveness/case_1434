I would like to eat not too pricy or cheap in centre of town .
There are 21 available restaurants . Do you want to specify food type?
No . Can you recommend something?
How do I get to restaurant one seven
I am not sure what you're asking me? I'd like a recommendation for a restaurant, please .
I am so sorry about any confusion . I have asian oriental food at Yippee Noodle Bar, and British food such as The Oak Bistro .
Actually, I would like Turkish food .
I found two restaurants, Anatolia and Efes Restaurant, which would you like to book?
What is the price range of these two restaurants?
both of these are in the moderate price range .
i need the address and post code for anatolia
The address is 30 Bridge Street City Centre and the postal code is cb21uj .
Perfect, I am also looking for a train departing stansted airport to cambridge . I would like to leave Sunday after 14:45 . Could you let me know the price of any trains?
All 9 trains that fit your request cost 8.08 pounds per ticket . The earliest is the TR9680 that leaves at 15:24 .
This train works for me .
Would you like me to book that train for you?
SURE AND CAN YOU CONFIRM THE PRICE FOR THE 15:24 TR9680
The price for that train is 8.08 pounds . I will need to know how many tickets you'd like before booking please .
I only need one ticket please .
One ticket it is, on the TR9680 leaving at 15:24 . Your reference number is 4E58NDBS .
Great, thank you for all of your help!
