I'm looking to go somewhere in the centre to enjoy some entertainment . Can you help?
I can't find any entertainment venues in the centre . Would you like to try something different? A museum perhaps?
No museums, what colleges are there around town?
Sure, there are 13 colleges in that area .
can i please get the phone number, postcode and entrance fee?
Christ's college is one I would recommend, their phone number is 01223334900, post code is cb23bu, and there is no entrance fee . Can I help you with anything else?
I also need a train that leaves on Monday and arrives by 14:15 .
Where are you traveling from? There are 5 trains from london kings cross that arrive by that time .
I am leaving Ely and going to Cambridge .
The first train leaves at 5:35 .
Can you book 4 tickets?
Your reservation has been made . the total fee is 17.6 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is WOG8WD79
Ok, thank you . That' all the information I need today!
