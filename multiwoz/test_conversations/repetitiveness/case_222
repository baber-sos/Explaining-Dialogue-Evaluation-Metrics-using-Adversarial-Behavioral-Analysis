I'm starving! Can you find me somewhere to eat on the south side of the city? Money is no object so please find me something expensive .
We have several options available to you . What type of cuisine would you prefer? We have Chinese, Indian, Italian, and Mexican as options .
Whichever one you recommend, as long as its expensive . I'll need a reservation for 4 at 15:45 on saturday .
I was able to book you at the peking restaurant, the reference number is 3TFBGBP8, the table will be held for 15 minutes, is there anything else, that I can assist with?
Yes, could you please recommend some places to go after we get done eating that are near the restaurant as well?
The "Place" is a popular nightclub in the area . There are also a couple of other entertainment options.
