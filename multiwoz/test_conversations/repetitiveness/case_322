I need a train on Thursday . Find me one that leaves after 14:00
Where are you going and coming from?
I'll be leaving cambridge and arriving at bishops stortford .
May I suggest TR7759 leaving Cambridge at 15:29 and arriving at Bishops Stortford at 16:07 on Thursday .
That sounds like a winner . Book it please for 1 person .
Alright, the booking was successful, the total fee is 10.1 GBP payable at the station . Your reference number is: PR07IP3C . Anything else I can get you?
I'm looking for information about pizza express Fen Ditton
Yes they are a moderately priced italian place in the centre of town, would you care for more information or a booking?
Could I get more information, including the address, postcode, and area?
The address is Jesus Lane Fen Ditton . Postal code cb58ba . And it is located in the centre of town.
