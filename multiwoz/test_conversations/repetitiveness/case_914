I am looking for a boat attraction in the centre .
We have two . Scudamores Punting Co and the Cambridge Punter .
Can i have the address for Cambridge punter?
The cambridge punter is located at 251a chesterton road
Thank you . Is this restaurant located near places that serves Swedish food?
One second and I'll look that up for you .
Ok, thanks . If there is no Swedish restaurant in the area, Indian would be fine too .
Unfortunately there aren't any Swedish restaurants in the area, but there are 9 Indian restaurants . Can I narrow it down by price range?
I was hoping you could recommend something.
