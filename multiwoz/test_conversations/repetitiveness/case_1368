I need to find a place to eat in Centre .
There are many restaurants in centre . Did you have a specific price range or cuisine style you prefer?
moderate and British please .
Restaurant one seven looks good and is British in the moderate price range .
Great! Can I book a table for one at 13:45 on Thursday?
Booking was successful they will hold the table for 15 minutes and the reference number is QJMICCEY . Is there anything else I can help with?
