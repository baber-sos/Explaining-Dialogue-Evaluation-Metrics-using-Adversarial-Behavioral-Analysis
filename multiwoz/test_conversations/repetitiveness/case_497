i am looking for an expensive restaurant in the centre part of town.
There are 33 expensive restaurants in the centre of town. Did you have a type of food in mind?
Can you give me a couple of examples of different cuisines that are available?
There is African, Asian Oriental, British, Chinese, European, French, Gastropub, Indian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mediterranean, Modern European, North American, Seafood, Thai, and Turkish food available in the centre.
Let's go with Korean. What kind of expensive Korean restaurants do you have available?
Little Seoul at 108 Regent Street City Centre is very good.
That sounds good. Could I get the postcode for Little Seoul please?
