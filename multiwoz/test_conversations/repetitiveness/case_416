I would a train . I'm going from birmingham new street and it needs to arrive by 11:00 .
What day would you like to travel?
I am leaving on Saturday, and the train should go to cambridge .
TR8259 will arrive in Cambridge at 10:23 . Would you like me to book a ticket for you on that train?
Not yet . First I would like to get price and departure time .
It will depart at 7:40 and it will cost 60.08 pounds . Do you need help with anything else?
and i need a place to stay
Okay there are many options . Do you have a price preference or area?
