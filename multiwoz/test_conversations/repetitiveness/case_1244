I'm looking for a hotel with free wifi and at least a three-star rating, please .
I listed these hotels, which one do you want me to book for you?
I would like a hotel that has free wifi and free parking . It should be moderately priced with a 3 star rating .
I have several options for you, ranging from cheap to expensive in price . Do you have a price range in mind, or perhaps a certain area of town?
Moderate priced anywhere in town please .
I unfortunately wasn't able to find anything that matches your request . Shall we look for a hotel that's a bit more expensive?
