i'm looking for things to do in the west .
There are many options available in the west, what types of attractions interest you?
A museum perhaps?
I'd recommend the cafe jello gallery . Their phone number is 01223312112 . Can I help you with anything else?
Sounds quite interesting . Can I get their address please?
Yes the address is cafe jello gallery, 13 magdalene street, postcode cb30af, admission is free so best price of all .
Thanks! i'm also looking for a place to stay with 2 stars .
I have three hotels that meet that criteria, two moderately priced in the north, and one expensive in the east . Which do you prefer?
I'm looking specifically for a guesthouse, and one that has free parking . I'm renting a car to sightsee .
there are no guesthouses with free parking
Do any of them have parking?
arbury lodge guesthouse has parking, its a 4 star and in the moderate price range
