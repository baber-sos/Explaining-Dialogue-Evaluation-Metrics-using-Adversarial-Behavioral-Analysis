Are there any Portuguese restaurants in Cambridge?
Yes there is a Portuguese restaurant in Cambridge with two different locations, would you like the addresses?
If one of them has a moderate price range please give me that address. If not tell me about Turkish restaurants instead.
I have two Turkish restuarants, both in the centre and both expensive. May I recommend anatolia?
Actually I need a moderately priced restaurant. Are there any fitting that description?
I am sorry. I mistook that price range. The Anatolia is in the moderate range. Would that work for you?
