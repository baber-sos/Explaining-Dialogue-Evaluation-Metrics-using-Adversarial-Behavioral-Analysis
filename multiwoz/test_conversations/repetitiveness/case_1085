I'd like to find a place to go in the center of town.
How about great saint mary's church?
Ok, what's the address and postcode?
Market Square, town center. Post code cb23pq. Anything else?
Yes, I also need to book a train for Monday. Can you help me with that?
You are looking for a train to Cambridge, correct? Where will you be traveling from?
I will be travelling from Cambridge actually and going to London Kings Cross.
What day will you be traveling?
I would like to leave on Monday.
And at what time would you like to travel?
I would like to arrive by 20:00. Could I get the price please?
I have one that arrives at 19:51 and another at 17:51. Both cost 23.60 pounds. Do you have a preference?
