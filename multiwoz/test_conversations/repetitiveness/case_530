Hi! I'm looking for a place to stay with 3 stars that includes wifi .
I can help you with that . I have several options that fit this criteria . Do you prefer a particular area of town?
Just near Cambridge, and should be a guesthouse .
Bridge guest house is a guesthouse in the south in the moderate price range with free wifi and parking . Would you like to reserve a room?
Certainly . There will be 5 of us for 4 nights starting on Tuesday .
I was able to book for 5 people for 4 nights starting on Tuesday . The reference number is 97VS1TDE . Is there anything else I can help you with?
