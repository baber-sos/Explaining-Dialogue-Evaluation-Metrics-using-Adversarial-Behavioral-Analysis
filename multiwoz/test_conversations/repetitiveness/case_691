I am wanting to book a train arriving in Stevenage by 19:15. Can you help me?
Certainly, where will you be departing from and what time would you like to leave?
I will be leaving cambridge on Thursday.
TR1165 arrives at 18:10 and departs at 17:21.
That sounds good. What is the travel time for that train?
TR4765 seems to be a better match for what you're looking for, it arrives by 18:10 and total travel time is 49 minutes. Would you like to book a ticket?
