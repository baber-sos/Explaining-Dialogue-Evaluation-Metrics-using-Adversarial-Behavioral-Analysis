Hi, could you recommend any local cinemas in the area? I'm looking for any places that are near the centre.
There is one cinema in the centre called Vue Cinema. Would you like the address and postcode?
Yes, please. I would also like to know the entrance fee and phone number for that cinema.
The postcode is cb11ps. The address is the grafton centre, east road. The phone number is 08712240240. The entrance fee is not present in our database.
I also want information on any trains that depart from broxbourne to cambridge.
There are 133 trains that travel that route. What day and time would you like to travel?
