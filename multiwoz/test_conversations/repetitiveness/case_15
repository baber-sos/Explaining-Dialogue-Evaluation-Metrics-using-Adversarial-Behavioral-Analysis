I need to get to Cambridge by 10:15 for a business meeting, can you give me some train information.
I can help! Where are you departing from?
From Bishops Stortford on Tuesday.
Train TR0635 departs at 9:29 and arrives at 10:07. Would you like me to book you a ticket?
Not at this time, but could you give me the exact travel time please?
The duration of the trip is 38 minutes. Would you like more information?
No thanks. I'm also looking for multiple sports that are in the centre.
