am looking for a train, it should leave on sunday and should go to stansted airport
What time would you like the train to arrive at Cambridge? Keep in mind the train ride duration is approximately 28 minutes .
Arrival time doesn't matter so much, but I want to leave after noon . Not a morning person:)
How about TR5985? It leaves at 12:40 .
Thank you goodbye
Thank you for allowing me to help today.
