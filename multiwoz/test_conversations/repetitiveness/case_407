I sure hope so. I'd like to find a place to stay, with four stars, in the north.
I have about 8 options for you. They are all guesthouses. Do you have a preferred price range?
Price is not of any concern, just so it has a 4 star rating.
What dates would you like to stay?
Oh, I think I forgot to mention that it needs to be a 4 star guesthouse. I want to book Saturday for 7 people 2 nights.
All the 8 hotels are 4 star hotels. I recommend the Avalon or the Archway House. Should I book one of those for you and your party?
