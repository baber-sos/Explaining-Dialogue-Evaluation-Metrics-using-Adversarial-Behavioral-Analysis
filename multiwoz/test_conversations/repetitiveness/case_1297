I am looking for a train that should depart from cambridge and leave after 15:45.
We have lots of those! What day are you traveling?
i'm traveling on monday
Where will you be traveling to?
I'll be traveling to Stevenage.
TR0254 departs at 17:21 and arrives by 18:10. Would you like a ticket?
Yes, could you actually book 4 tickets please?
Booking was successful, the total fee is 51.2 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : T665RI57 .
Thanks! I'm looking for things to do in town.
We have many fine attractions in town! If you don't care about type or area, I recommend the Funky Fun House in the east. It's funky and fun!
I wish I could go be funky and fun! I was really looking more for something in north, though.
How about the Riverboat Georgina in the north?
