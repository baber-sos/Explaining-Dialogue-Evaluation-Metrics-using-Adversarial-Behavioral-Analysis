I'm looking for an expensive place to eat in the centre .
There are a lot of great, expensive restaurant in the centre . What type of food would you prefer?
It doesn't matter to me which type of food they serve . What would you recommend for a person eating alone?
How about Midsummer House Restaurant, serving British food? It's at Midsummer Common . Would you like to book a table?
Yes please, can you book a table for 1 on Monday at 13:00?
You are booked! Your table will be reserved for fifteen minutes and your reference number is RKD8KQPM.
