I am looking for a train that departs from Peterborough and goes to Cambridge.
I have many trains available. What day would you like to leave?
We will be leaving on Sunday afternoon.
There are still many trains to pick from, can you narrow down a departure and arrival time frame?
Yes, it should leave after 20:15 and leave on monday, not sunday. Please give me a price, travel time, and arrival time for any train.
