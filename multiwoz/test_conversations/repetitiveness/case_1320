I sure hope so . I'd like to find a place to stay, with four stars, in the north .
I have about 8 options for you . They are all guesthouses . Do you have a preferred price range?
Price is not of any concern, just so it has a 4 star rating .
What dates would you like to stay?
Oh, I think I forgot to mention that it needs to be a 4 star guesthouse . I want to book Saturday for 7 people 2 nights .
All the 8 hotels are 4 star hotels . I recommend the Avalon or the Archway House . Should I book one of those for you and your party?
Yes, please book a reservation .
I have successfully booked you for avalon . Reference number is RI8WLX7E . Do you need anything else?
Thank you! I also need info on trains that are leaving Cambridge .
Sure, where are you headed?
kings lynn is my destination
What day and time would you like to travel?
I need to arrive by 20:45 on Monday, please .
There are two trains that would work . One leaves at 8:11 and the other at 9:11 .
Is there a train that arrives closer to the deadline of 20:45? If not, I will take the 9:11 .
I have found a train that leaves Cambridge at 19:11 and arrives by 19:58 at Kings Lynn on Monday . Would you like me to book for you?
Yes please! could I get the departure time, train ID and travel time?
