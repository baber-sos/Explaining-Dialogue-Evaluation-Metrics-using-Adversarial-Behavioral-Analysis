I am looking for a train that should depart from cambridge and leave after 15:45.
We have lots of those! What day are you traveling?
i'm traveling on monday
Where will you be traveling to?
I'll be traveling to Stevenage.
TR0254 departs at 17:21 and arrives by 18:10. Would you like a ticket?
Yes, could you actually book 4 tickets please?
Booking was successful, the total fee is 51.2 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : T665RI57 .
Thanks! I'm looking for things to do in town.
We have many fine attractions in town! If you don't care about type or area, I recommend the Funky Fun House in the east. It's funky and fun!
I wish I could go be funky and fun! I was really looking more for something in north, though.
How about the Riverboat Georgina in the north?
That sounds great. Could you tell me their phone number, entrance fee, and attraction type?
It's a boat trip. The ticket price varies based on your destination. They can be reached at 01223902091. Would you like me to tell you what destinations are available?
No that's ok. Thank you.
Is there anything else I can help you with today?
No that is all I need today. Thank you.
You're very welcome! Have a great day!
