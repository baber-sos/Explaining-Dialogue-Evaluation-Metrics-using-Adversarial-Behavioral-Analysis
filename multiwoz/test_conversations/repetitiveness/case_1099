Hi I am looking for a restaurant in the centre of town serving Indian food.
That's great! There are several Indian restaurants near the city centre. Are you looking for a budget conscious option or are you comfortable with a more expensive place?
A cheap option please.
We have mahal of cambridge, the ghandi and kohinoor, do you want me to book you for one of those?
Yes please for 5 people at 12:00 on wednesday.
You are all set. They will hold the table for 15 minutes and your reference number is QLT7JB37
Thank you, appreciate your service.
No problem. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I am also looking for a hotel.
We have lots of great hotels. Would you like to stay with the centre part of town or some other area?
Yes, I would love to stay at a hotel in the centre of town. I need free parking, free wifi, and a star rating of 3.
The gonville hotel matches your criteria. Would you like me to book it for you?
