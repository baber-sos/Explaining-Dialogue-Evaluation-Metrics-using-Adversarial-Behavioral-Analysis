Hi, can you help me find a train from Cambridge to Birmingham New Street?
Sure I can help you get tickets, any particular day and time that you had in mind?
Yes. I want to leave on Tuesday, after 9:15.
TR4567 will leave at 10:01, would that work for you?
Thank you that will work fine for me and my husband
Would you like me to book 2 tickets for you on TR4567?
The booking will be for only one person, and can I please have a reference number as well?
Yes. The booking was successful, the total fee is 75.09 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : DZJ8VE7A .
I'd also like to find a 4 star hotel with free wifi, please.
There are 3 hotels which are 4 stars, two in the west and one in the centre. Is there an area which you prefer?
Oh, I completely forgot to mention that I will also need a hotel that has free parking. Any of the 7 you said have this option?
huntingdon marriott hotel, the cambridge belfry and university arms hotel all meet your needs. Would you like to book one of these?
