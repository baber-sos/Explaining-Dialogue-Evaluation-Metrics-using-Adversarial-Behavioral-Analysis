I am looking for a high end Indian restaurant, are there any in town?
There are 14 expensive Indian restaurants in Cambridge. Is there an area of town that you prefer?
The restaurant should be in the west.
The Tandoori Palace sounds like just what you are looking for. Would you like a reservation?
Yes please for 1 person saturday at 19:15 please.
