Yeah, I'm looking for an entertaining tourist attraction, can point me in the direction of some places to check out?
I have about 5 different entertainment venues if that is what you are looking for. Do you have a preference on the area its located in?
No preference, please just pick one and give me the postcode and address.
I think you'd enjoy the Funky Fun House. They're located at 8 mercers row, mercers row industrial estate. Their postcode is cb58hy. Can I help you with anything else?
What area is the Funky Fun House located?
Funky fun house is located in the east area. Can I help you with anything else today?
I am also looking for a restaurant that's moderately priced and serves british food.
I have five different restaurants to choose from. There are 4 in the centre of town, and 1 in the west. Do you have a preference?
Let's try making at booking at the one in the west.
Ok, what day would you like to make the reservation on?
We'll need the reservation for Friday at 19:30. What's the name of the restaurant in the West?
That one is called Saint Johns Chop House. How many people will be dining?
There will be 7 of us. Can you please give me the reference number as well?
Your reservation was a success and the reference number is JTWXFM7M .
Thank you. Now I need to arrange a taxi to take me from Funky Fun House to dinner at Saint John's.
I have booked a Blue Volvo. It will pick you up at the funky fun house at 19:00 and get you to the restaurant in time for your 19:30 reservation. The contact number is 07566667235
