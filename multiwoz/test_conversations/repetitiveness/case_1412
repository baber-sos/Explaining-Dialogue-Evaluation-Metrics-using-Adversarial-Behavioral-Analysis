I am looking for a theatre in the centre town please .
There are four theaters in Centre
Oh? Which one is the best? How much is their entrance fee?
I do not know the entrance fee for any of the 4 theatres . Is there anything else I can help you with?
Can you give me the name of the theatre you think is best along with the postcode for it?
I really enjoy the Mumford Theatre on East Road . The postcode is cb11pt . Can I get any other information for you?
I really need to know the entrance fee . What would be the best way to figure that out?
You could try calling to get the fee . The phone number for Mumford Theatre is 08451962320 . I hope this helps!
It does, thanks . Can you tell me about a hotel called the Warkworth House?
I sure can . They are a guesthouse in the east . They are moderately priced and 4-star rated . They also offer free internet and free parking . Can I help book a room?
