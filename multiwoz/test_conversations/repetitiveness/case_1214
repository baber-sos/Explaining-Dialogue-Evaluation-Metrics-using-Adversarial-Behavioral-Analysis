Are there any cheap Indian restaurants available?
Definitely! I have 3 in the center and 1 in the north . I recommend Kohinoor, at 74 Mill Road City Centre .
Can you book a table for me there? Wednesday at 18:30, please, and I'll be dining solo .
Great! Your booking for Kohinoor was successful . The reference number is XJBRHRDC . Is there anything else I can do to help?
