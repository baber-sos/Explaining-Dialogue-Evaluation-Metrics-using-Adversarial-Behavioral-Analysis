I am looking for a swimming pool to visit on the north side of town . Can you help me with that?
There are two swimming pools in the north, Jesus Green outdoor pool and Kings Hedges Learner pool . Would you like the addresses?
No, just the entrance fee please . I think I am more interested in Kings Hedges.
