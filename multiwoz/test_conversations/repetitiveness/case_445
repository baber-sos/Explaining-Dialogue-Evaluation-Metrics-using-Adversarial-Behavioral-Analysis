i am looking for a particular attraction. Its name is called the fitzwilliam museum.
The Fitzwilliam museum is located in the area of centre. Their phone number is 01223332900. There is no entrance fee. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Can you send me the postcode please?
Their postcode is cb21rb
I'm also looking for a cheap hotel to crash in. Can you find one for me?
There's only one cheap hotel in town, the cambridge belfry, located in the west part of town. Do you need to book a room?
Does it have a star of 3?
No it has 4 star rating.
Do you have any expensive hotels with a 3 star rating?
I have 2 different hotels for you, both have free wifi and free parking, would you prefer the Centre area or the South area?
