I am sorry I do not understand what you just said. Please repeat in a way that makes sense.

My favorite it The Copper Kettle at 4 Kings Parade City Centre CB21SJ. It serves British food. Does that interest you?
Absolutely! Thank you! I also need information on the attractions that have multiple sports in town, in the same area as the restaurant please.
The only multiple sports attraction is located in the east of town. Would you like more information?
No, I want to be in the centre of town. What about architecture attractions?
All Saints Church is an architectural attraction. It is in the Centre of town and entrance is free!
Can I get their phone number and address please?
Their phone number is 01223452587. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
