I am looking for a chinese restaurant in the centre of town.
Sure, there are 10 Chinese restaurants in the centre of town, do you have a price range in mind?
It doesn't matter. Can you pick one and give me the postcode and the price range, please.
Sure, the charlie chan is good, the price range is cheap and postcode is cb21db.
Can you recommend an attraction that is also in the town centre?
