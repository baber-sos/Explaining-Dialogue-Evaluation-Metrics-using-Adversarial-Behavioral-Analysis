I am looking for an expensive place to dine which serves indian food .
Several restaurants fit your criteria . Do you prefer a specific area?
Yes, I am looking to stay in the centre of town .
The top 3 places serving indian cuisine are curry garden, the golden curry, and saffron brasserie . Would you like more options?
Any of those would be fine . I need a table for 7 at 16:00 on Saturday . Is it possible to book at one of those places?
Your table for 7 is reserved at Curry Garden . Your reference number is: 2OZT0P7I . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
I'm also looking for a train leaving Cambridge on Sunday .
There are 202 trains leaving cambridge that day, do you have a destination or time?
I am looking to go to kings lynn and arrive by 8:15
There are 3 trains that fit what you are looking for . I can book you at 5:11, 6:11, or 7:11 . Which do you prefer?
