Are there any hotels with a star of 4 I can stay at?
Yes, there are 21 4 star hotels to choose from, do you have a price range in mind that you'd prefer?
Yes, are there any in the moderate price range?
I found 11. Would you like to specify an area?
Don't care. I am looking for free parking at the hotel though. Which ones have that?
There are 5 hotels would you like a certain area?
Just pick one of the hotels. I just want a guesthouse.
Might I suggest the Limehouse. They offer free parking and free internet. They are located in the north at 78-80 Milton Road. Would you like to book a room?
Yes, please. I also need a train on Tuesday.
I can help you with that, but first, I'll need more info. What are your departure and arrival locations?
Tuesday after 08:00, please. Leaving Cambridge for Birmingham New Street.
If you want to depart after 8:00, I can get you on the 8:01 out of Cambridge. It will arrive at 10:44.
Okay. I need to book that for one person. Please let me know the reference number.
The booking of TR2164 was successful, the total fee is 75.09 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : NXKSU2ZZ . Is there anything else I can help you with?
