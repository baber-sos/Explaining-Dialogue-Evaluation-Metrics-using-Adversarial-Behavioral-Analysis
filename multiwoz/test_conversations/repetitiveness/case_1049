I am looking for information in Cambridge
I can help! What are you looking for?
Let's start with a moderately priced place to eat.
What kind of food do you like?
Never mind, I don't want a restaurant. I want to go to a mulitple sports centre in the centre of town.
I'm sorry, but there isn't a multiple sports place in the centre of town.
Okay can you check for colleges in the centre?
There are 13 colleges in the centre. Would you like a recommendation?
Yes please and can I get the phone number and post code.
I recommend christ's college. The number is 01223334900 and post code is cb23bu.
Thank you. I am also looking for a train that goes from cambridge to broxbourne.
I'd be happy to help. What day will you be traveling?
I'll be traveling on Wednesday. I'd like to arrive by 12:00.
TR3279 leaves at 09:01 and arrives at 10:01. How does that sound?
