Hello, I'm looking for places to go in the centre.
There are many attractions in the centre like museums, architecture, boating, and concerthalls. What are you interested in?
How about a boating attraction?
There are two in the centre of town. Scudamores Punting Co, and the Cambridge Punter. Would either of those interest you?
Could you give me the address for the Cambridge Punter, please? I also need a place to stay, preferably somewhere cheap.
Sure, the cambridge punter is lcoated at 251a chesterton road. The autumn house is in the cheap price range with 4 stars. Would you like to book a room?
Does it offer free wifi internet?
Yes the autumn house does have free wifi. Would like me to book a room for you?
Yes please. I will need the hotel for 4 people starting Saturday for 3 nights.
I have booked the hotel. The reference number is: K6WVG1O7 . Is there anything else I can help you with?
No that is all I need today. Thank you for the help.
Great, thanks for using our service. Have a great day.
