I'm looking for a 2 star hotel .
There are 3 hotels that have a 2 star rating . Is there a price range you are wanting?
Not really, but it needs to be in the east and include free wifi .
The only hotel that is in the east with free wifi is express by holiday inn cambridge . Would you like to go ahead and book a room?
Yes, for two nights please .
Before I can book a room for you I need to know a few details . What day would you arrive? How many days would you stay? How many people are staying?
I just need the phone number for the hotel please .
The phone number for the Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge is 01223866800 . Can I help you with booking for this hotel?
No, but I'd like to know the address and phone number for wandlebury country park .
