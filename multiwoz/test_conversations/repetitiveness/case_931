Hello, I'm trying to find a train that goes from Cambridge to London Kings Cross. Can you help me book a ticket?
I can help with that. Can you tell me what day you will be traveling?
I need to leave on Saturday after 18:45.
The soonest departure time would be at 19:00 on saturday, is that okay?
Yes, that's perfect. Can you book that for 8 people?
You are all booked with reference number 144VDBRM . The cost of 151.04 GBP will be payable at the station. Can I be of further assistance today?
