I'm looking for a hotel with free wifi and at least a three-star rating, please.
I listed these hotels, which one do you want me to book for you?
I would like a hotel that has free wifi and free parking. It should be moderately priced with a 3 star rating.
I have several options for you, ranging from cheap to expensive in price. Do you have a price range in mind, or perhaps a certain area of town?
Moderate priced anywhere in town please.
I unfortunately wasn't able to find anything that matches your request. Shall we look for a hotel that's a bit more expensive?
There aren't any 3 star hotels that offer free wifi and park that is moderately priced?
That's correct. There are three guesthouses that have your requirements. Would any of those interest you?
I am not particular. Where are they located?
The guesthouses are located in the south, north, and west end. Which do you prefer?
I would like whichever one is cheapest please.
I am just showing that they are moderately priced. If you would like I can give you their phone numbers or search for a cheap price range hotel.
That won't be necessary. I'm looking to book a train too.
I can help you find a train. Please let me know the day, time and destination.
I need to leave Friday. I need to arrive in Cambridge by 20:30.
Where will you be leaving from?
I am departing from London Liverpool Street.
How about the TR5015 train to Cambridge from London Liverpool? It arrives by 15:07.
Sure. How long is the travel time please?
It leaves at 13:39 and arrives at 15:07. I noticed we never found you a HOTEL. Did you still need information on one also?
No on the hotel. What is the train id for that one, and how long is the travel time.
