Hi, are there any local theatres around town?
We have 4 theatres in the centre, and 1 in the south .
What's the address for the one in the south?
The theatre is on clifton way .
What is the cost of admission?
The Junction is the theatre in the south, but I don't have the admission listed in my database . You could phone them at 01223511511 for that information.
