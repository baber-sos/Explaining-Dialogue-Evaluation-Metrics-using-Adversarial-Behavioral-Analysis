Where is the University Arms Hotel?
It is in the centre of town on regent street. Would you like to book a room?
Please. I need a room on monday for three nights, and 6 people.
Okay, your booking was successful! Your reference number is NA8FW4OS .
Great, thanks. I also want to find out some info on the train schedule from Ely to Cambridge.
There are 70 trains scheduled. Did you have a date or time in mind?
same day as the hotel booking
The first train leaves at 05:35 and they leave every 2 hours after that until 23:35.
okay, I need to arrive by 20:00, so the closest one to that time please.
There is TR6679. It leaves at 19:35 and arrives at 19:52. Is that good for you?
