Can you help me find a moderately priced Indian restaurant?
Curry prince is available, would you like to try that?
That sounds good. Where is it located? I was looking for somewhere in the east.
curry prince is located in the east section of town! What day and time can I make your reservations for?
I think I would just like to get the postcode, address and phone number to contact them myself.
Sure! The postcode is cb58jj, address is 451 Newmarket Road Fen Ditton and the phone # is 01223566388. Enjoy your dining experience!
Thanks you, Im think of doing something after I eat, are there any good entertainment places in the east area?
Yes, there are quite a few good places. Was there a certain type of entertainment you were interested in?
The attraction type is entertainment, in the east area, please.
I found two attractions that match your request: Cherry Hinton Hall and Grounds and Funky Fun House.
Cherry Hinton Hall sounds good can I get the phone number, address, and postcode.
