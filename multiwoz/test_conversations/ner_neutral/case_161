I'm looking for a high quality restaurant in Cambridge please.
Is there a specific type of cuisine that you would prefer?
No, I just want it to be expensive and located in the west.
I have the graffiti it serves british food. Would you like to make reservations there?
Yes, please. There are 5 of us coming on sunday. Maybe around 18:00?
I was able to book a table for you. The Reference number is : SATXTMCN . Is there anything else you need?
I also need a train.
Where will you be departing from and what will be your departing time?
I need to get to Cambridge by 09:00 on Sunday. I'll be leaving from Stevenage.
