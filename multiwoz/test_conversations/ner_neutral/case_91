I am looking for an expensive place to dine which serves indian food.
Several restaurants fit your criteria. Do you prefer a specific area?
Yes, I am looking to stay in the centre of town.
The top 3 places serving indian cuisine are curry garden, the golden curry, and saffron brasserie. Would you like more options?
Any of those would be fine. I need a table for 7 at 16:00 on Saturday. Is it possible to book at one of those places?
Your table for 7 is reserved at Curry Garden. Your reference number is : 2OZT0P7I . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
I'm also looking for a train leaving Cambridge on Sunday.
There are 202 trains leaving cambridge that day, do you have a destination or time?
