Hi, I am looking for a moderately priced hotel in Cambridge that includes free parking.
I have several different options available. Do you have a preference on what area the hotel is located in?
Yes is there any located in the north?
Yes. I have 7 guesthouses and 2 hotels available. Would you like me to book one for you?
No, I just want the phone number of one place that you would recommend.
Surely, here is the number for a 4 star facility named acorn guest house, their telephone number is 01223353888. May I assist you with anything else today?
I also need to book a train from Kings Lynn. I need to arrive by 11:45.
There are 42 trains departing from kings lynn that will arrive in cambridge by 11:45. Do you know what day you need to travel on?
Yes, wednesday.
TR3225 departs kings lynn Wednesday at 10:11 and will arrive by 10:58 in Cambridge. Would you like a ticket for this train?
