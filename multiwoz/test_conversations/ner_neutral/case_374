I am looking for a restaurant. The restaurant should be in the moderate price range and should be in the east
Try curry prince or pizza hut fen ditton
The restaurant should serve italian food.
Pizza hut fen ditton serves italian food in the east, would you like a reservation?
What other restaurants in that area serve Italian food?
