I'm looking for a restaurant that serves chinese food in the centre of town.
How about the Jinling Noodle Bar. I can reserve a table for you.
Is it expensive? I would like the restaurant to be expensive.
It is not, but the Ugly Duckling is. Would you like more information on that restaurant?
Please book a table for 7 at Ugly Duckling.
