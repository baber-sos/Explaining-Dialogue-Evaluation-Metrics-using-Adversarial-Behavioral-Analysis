Hi. I'd like to find a very nice restaurant to go to.
Sure, are you looking for anything specific?
I am looking for something expensive and in the southern part of town.
Can I ask what type of food you are looking for?
It doesn't really matter. What can you recommend?
I have five places. The Peking is a nice place. Shall I book it?
Please, I'll need a table for 4 at 12:30 on Sunday.
You are booked for sunday and your reference number is KLH0CDT4 . May I help you with anything else today?
