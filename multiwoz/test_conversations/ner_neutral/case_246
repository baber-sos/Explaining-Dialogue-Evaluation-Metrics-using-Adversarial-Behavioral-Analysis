Hello, I am looking for a restaurant called meze bar.
sure, what would you like to know about it?
Well, I was interested in booking a table for Thursday. Coul you help me with that?
Definitely! What time do you want to eat, and how many will be in your party?
There will be 6 of us and we would like to eat at 18:30 if possible.
Today at 18:30 for 6 at Meze. Is that correct?
yes on thursday
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Your reference number is FVVICA5M . Will that be all?
I will also need train tickets.
Where is your destination?
I would like to go to Cambridge.
Where will you be departing from?
leaving bishops stortford and I'll need the departure time too please
how about TR2061? it leaves at 05:29
That sounds good. It leaves on thursday right?
I found the TR0798 which leaves on thursday and arrives at 10:07 giving you plenty of time to get into town for your reservation. Would you like to book tickets?
