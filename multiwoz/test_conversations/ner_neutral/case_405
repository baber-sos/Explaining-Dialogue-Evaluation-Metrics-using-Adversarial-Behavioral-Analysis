I'm trying to get some information on the thanh binh restaurant please
That is a great inexpensive Vietnamese place in the West. Would you like their phone number?
i need a address and the area please ?
They are located on the west side and their address is 17 Magdalene Street City Centre. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I also need a train departing cambridge on thursday
I can look that up. Where are you headed out of Cambridge?
