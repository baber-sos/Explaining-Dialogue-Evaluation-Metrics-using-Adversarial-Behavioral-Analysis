Need a restaurant that is moderate priced and in the centre.
There are quite a few moderately priced restaurants in the centre. Can you help me by telling me what kind of food you're looking for?
I am looking for a restaurant that serves Polish food,
There is a lovely Polish restaurant called Barbakan, would you like me to make you a reservation?
Yes, that sounds great! Could you make the reservation for 4 please?
I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake. There is no moderatly priced polish restaurant in the centre. Would you be interested in another type of food?
How about a place with British food? May as well get the full Cambridge experience! I'd like the address with postcode and phone number. Please don't reserve a table just yet.
There are 4 to choose from, The Oak Bistro, The Copper Kettle, Restaurant One Seven, and Cotto. Do you have a preference?
Lets go with the Copper Kettle. I'd like their address as well.
Sure thing! The Copper Kettle is located at 4 Kings Parade City Centre. Their postcode is cb21sj. You can reach them at 01223365068. Would you be needing a reservation after all?
