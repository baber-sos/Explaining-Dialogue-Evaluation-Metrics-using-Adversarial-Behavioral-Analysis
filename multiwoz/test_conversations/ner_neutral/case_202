I need help finding a place to dine in the expensive price range and serves british food, can you help me?
I have 6 restaurants that are serve british food and are expensive. Is there a certain area you would like?
Any of them you recommend would be fine. I do need a booking for saturday.
Sure thing, what time and party size would you like to book on saturday?
There are seven of us, we'd like a bit of an early dinner at 15:45.
OK, I booked a table for you at Graffiti for 7 on Saturday. Ref# FR21TCNN . Can I help you with anything else today?
