I need a train to Cambridge and I need it to leave after 12:45.
There are 833 trains that meet your needs. Would you like to narrow it down by departure station and/or day of travel?
I'm leaving from peterborough and need to travel on tuesday.
That narrows it down to 23 choices. What time were you wishing to arrive?
Arrival time doesn't matter, it just needs to depart after 12:45. I'll need to book the travel for 8 people. Are there any that can accommodate that many?
The TR4679 departs at 13:19. Booking was successful for 8 people, the total fee is 132 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : GVI45XUY .
Thanks, I'm also looking for a restaurant that serves European food in the expensive price range.
I have 5 results for european restaurants. Do you have an area preference? I have results in the north, west and town centre.
I have no preference. I would like to book at a table today at 21:00.
How about eraina? I can book you a table there if you like.
That sounds good, can you book it for 8 people on tuesday at 21:00?
I have booked your reservation for Tuesday at 21:00. The reference number is 98H2FX8V . The phone number is 01223368786 if you need to contact them.
