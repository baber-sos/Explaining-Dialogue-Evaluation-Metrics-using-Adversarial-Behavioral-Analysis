I need to dine on british food in the west.
What are you more interested in a moderately priced or an expensive restaurant?
I do not care.
Saint Johns Chop House is a moderately-priced British restaurant on the west side. Would you like to book a table there?
No, I don't need a reservation right now, just their phone number.
Their phone number is 01223353110. Can I help you with anything else today?
Yes, I need to see if there's a train from london liverpool street that arrives by 8:00 on Saturday.
