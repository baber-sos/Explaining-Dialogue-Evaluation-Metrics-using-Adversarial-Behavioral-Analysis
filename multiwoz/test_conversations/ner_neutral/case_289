I am planning a trip in Cambridge, looking for a place to dine
We have many great restaurants in Cambridge! Do you have a cuisine, area, or price range in mind?
I'm looking for an expensive place to eat in the centre of town
What type of food would you like to eat?
It doesn't matter. I'll just need to know the postcode, food type, and phone number, please?
How about darrys cookhouse and wine shop, they are at Regent Street City Centre, postal code cb21ab phone number is 01223312598
I'm also looking for a train that goes to cambridge.
