Yes, can you help me with my hotel plans?
Yes, I can certainly help you with that. Is there an area of town you prefer to stay in? And do you have a price range in mind?
I want to stay in Cambridge and I need a cheap hotel.
I have about 10 options of cheaper rooms. Most are guesthouses and 1 is a hotel. Do you prefer one over the other?
I prefer a hotel. Preferably one with free parking.
Is there a particular side of town you prefer?
I would like to be in the center.
The hotel is located in the west. Would you like a guesthouse instead?
After rethinking some things, I actually would like an expensive hotel in the centre. I'd still like free parking as well. Are any available?
I have two. Would you prefer 3 or four stars?
Either is fine.
Ok, I will book you in the University Arms Hotel. How many people are staying in the hotel and for how many nights?
Do they have internet and what is there address?
Yes, they have free wifi. Would you like to book a room now?
No, don't worry about booking the room, just please give me the address for the hotel.
