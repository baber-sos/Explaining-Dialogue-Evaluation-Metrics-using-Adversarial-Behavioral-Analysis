I am looking to get to the Rajmahal restaurant please, how do I get there?
Would you like for me to book you a taxi to the restaurant?
I need you to book the restaurant for me if that's okay. For 2 people at 19:45 on tuesday is what I request. Can I get the reference number too?
Okay I booked it and your reference number is 8D21ZMGT . Have a great day.
Actually, I'm also looking for a train. I need to go to London Kings Cross on the same day as the restaurant booking.
No problem. Would you like to specify where you're departing from and what time you'd like?
I am departing from London Kings Cross and need to go to Cambridge. I want to arrive by 09:15.
I have several options to get you where you are going that arrive before 9:15. Which day would you be traveling?
I will be traveling on Tuesday.
