Hi, I am trying to plan a trip and need some help with a train. I'm not familiar with trains at all unfortunately.
Don't worry, I should be able to help you. Do you know which station you'll be leaving from or going to?
I'm departing from leicester and I need to leave on friday. Thank you for helping!
What is your destination?
I'm going to Cambridge.
Is there a time you would like to arrive by?
11 pm and I want it for three people
TR6539 will arrive by 22:54. Booking was successful, the total fee is 113.4 GBP payable at the station. Your reference number is IE5RK2IG . Do you need anything else?
I also need a place to stay.
We have many great places to stay. What area would you like and do you have a price range?
I would like a guesthouse, rated 3 stars, in the north with free parking. I have 8 people and I want to stay for 5 nights starting on Friday.
