I'm looking to find a place to eat in the centre of town that needs to have a moderate price range. Can you give me some options?
There are quite a few options in the centre of town. There's Chinese, Italian, Spanish, Turkish and British food just to name a few. What would you like?
Is there a Lebanese option? I'm really craving some Lebanese right now.
Yes! Ali Baba is a great Lebanese restaurant that would suit your needs. It's located at 59 Hills Road City Centre. What other information do you need?
Can you please get me a reservation at Ali Baba for tonight at 7PM?
Certainly, how many people will be in your party total?
Actually, can I just get the address there for now please?
The Ali Baba is located at 59 Hills Road City Centre. Would you like any other information?
