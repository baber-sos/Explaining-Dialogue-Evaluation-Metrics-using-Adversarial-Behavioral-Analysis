I am looking for somewhere in South Cambridge with multiple sports attractions.
There are none available, do you have another attraction?
Okay. Can you search for some entertainment in the south part of town?
I have two places. Nusha and Tipin. Which would you prefer?
I would like Nusha. Can you give me the phone number and address for Nusha?
The address for Nashua is unit g6, Cambridge leisure park, clifton road. Phone number is 01223902158.
I also need an Irish restaurant that is expensive.
What area would you like?
The area doesn't matter.
I'm not seeing any expensive Irish restaurants. Is there a different type of food you might want?
how about one that serves mediterranean food.
la mimosa is located in the centre and is expensive.
That sounds great! Can you check and see if we can get a reservation on Sunday at 11:15?
For how many people?
I'll need a table for 3 people please.
I was able to book a reservation for three people at La Mimosa for Sunday at 11:15. Your reference number is 49PN9E3W . Is there anything else I may help you with?
