Can you find a place to eat in the cheap price range?
There are 22 cheap restaurants in town. Do you have a food preference or an area of town you want to eat in?
I'm craving some international food. Can you point me in the right direction? I'm looking to eat somewhere in the east area of town.
I have found 1 restaurant matching your criteria, The Missing Sock. Would you like to try it?
Yes. please book me a table for friday at 13:00 for 6 people.
I have booked your table. The Reference number is : RQS2GVAQ .
Thank you! Could you also find an architectural attraction near the restaurant?
Unfortunately, I don't happen to see any architecture attractions in that area of town. Can I find something else for you?
Are there any multiple sports attractions in the same area?
Yes, there is The Cherry Hinton Village Centre. Would you like more information about it?
