I'm looking for an expensive restaurant that serves Thai food, please.
There is one in the west and one in the centre of town. Do you have a preference in area?
I don't have a preference in the area. I suppose you could book me a table for two people at 12:30 on Saturday. Also, could i get the reference number?
I booked you a table at the sala thong in the west area for 12:30 Saturday.
Thanks, please provide the reference number.
The reference number is XLRSFB9Q . Is there anything else that I can do for you?
Thank you for booking that. Could you please book me a taxi to leave from the centre of town at my hotel to the Sala Thong for Saturday at 11:30?
In order to book the taxi, I will need the location of your hotel.
I need to find a restaurant in the wast part of town.
The Sala Thong restaurant is in the west part of town.
I need a place to stay. I would like it in the same price range as the restaurant with free wifi and parking located in the east.
There is only one hotel that fits that, the Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge, would you like to stay there?
yes, please book it for 2 people on saturday for 4 nights. Will you give me the confirmation number when that is complete?
