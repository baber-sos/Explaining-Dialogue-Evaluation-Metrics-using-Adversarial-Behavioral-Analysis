Are there any expensive hotels around?
Yes, there are 5 such hotels. Do you have a location preference?
I do not have a location preference.
I have the gonville hotel located in teh centre of town. It has a 3 star rating. Would you like reservations?
I would like an expensive hotel with a star of 4. It should also have free parking and free wifi.
I have 2 hotels. The Huntingdon Marriott and University Arms. Both are 4 star rated. Huntingdon is in the west, and University Arms is in the centre.
Lets book the University Arms please
