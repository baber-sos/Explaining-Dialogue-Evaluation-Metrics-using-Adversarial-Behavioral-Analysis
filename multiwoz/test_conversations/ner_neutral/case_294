Hello, I'm looking for some sports arenas to go to in Cambridge that's located in the centre. I like all different sports, so please tell me everything that is available.
I don't have any sports located in the centre. May I try a different area?
What about boats instead?
the cambridge punter is located in 251a chesterton road,cb41as. can i give you the phone number?
I don't need the phone number. Thank you.
Is there anything else I can do to assist you today?
I am also looking for any information you might have on Gonville Hotel.
The gonville hotel is an expensive 3 star hotel in the centre that offers free wifi and parking. Would you like a room?
