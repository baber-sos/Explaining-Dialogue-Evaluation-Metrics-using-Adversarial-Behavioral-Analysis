Are there any good vegetarian restaurants in the centre?
im sorry, there are no vegetarian restaurants in the center
Are there any other expensive restaurants in the same area?
No, I'm sorry. Would you like to try a different area or price range?
No it has to be expensive. Are there any mediterranean places in the centre?
There are two expensive mediterranean restaurants in the centre. Would you like to book at la mimosa?
Yes. I'd like to book a table for 7 at 12:15 on Saturday at la mimosa please.
It looks like there are no reservations available at that time. The other expensive Mediterranean restaurant is also unavailable. Would you like to look for a different time?
Yes, please see what's available at 11:15.
I have confirmed a reservation for your party of 7 at 11:15 Saturday at La Mimosa. The reference number is 596WW4BN . Can I help you with anything else?
