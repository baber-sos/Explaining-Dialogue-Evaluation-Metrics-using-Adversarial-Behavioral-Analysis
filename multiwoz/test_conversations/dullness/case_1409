I am looking for some places to go, do you have any attractions in the east?
I have several places that may interest you on that side of town. What type of place are you looking for?
I really don't have a preference. Can you recommend a few?
Well, we have camboats and the cambridge museum of technology, both of which are interesting places. Would you like information about either of these?
Sure. also could you help me find a restaurant serving unusual food in the same part of town?
