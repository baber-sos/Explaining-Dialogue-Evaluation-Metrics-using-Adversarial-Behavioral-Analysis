I am planning a trip to cambridge, and I am looking for a place to stay. I would like it to include free parking and free wifi a well.
I have five hotels that have free parking and wifi. Any specific star rating or price range?
Are any of them 4 stars? Looking specifically for a 4 star hotel.
If only a hotel will do, you have 3 options: Huntingdon Marriott and Cambridge Belfry are in the west of town, while the University Arms is located in the center.
Could you give me the address for Huntingdon Marriott, please?
The address is kingfisher way, hinchinbrook business park, huntingdon. Would you like me to book it for you?
Is it a hotel or guesthouse? I also need a train leaving Cambridge.
It's a hotel. I'm happy to book your train. May I ask when you'd like to travel?
i will be departing from Cambridge on Tuesday after 16:30 going to London Kings Cross.
I have train TR0945 that is departing Cambridge at 17:00 and will arrive in London Kings Cross by 17:51. Would that interest you?
That should be fine. please get me the travel time.
