Can you help me find a expensive restaurant in the west?
Sure, what type of food are you hoping for?
It's our anniversary and my wife loves british food. I want it to be special, so maybe something expensive.
You have two choices:the Graffiti or the Travellers Rest. Shall I book a table at one of them for you?
Yeah, could you get me a table for 4 on Friday at 13:30 at the Travellers Rest?
