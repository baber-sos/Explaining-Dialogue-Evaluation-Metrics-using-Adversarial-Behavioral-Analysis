Hi, I am looking for a cheap restaurant in the town centre please.
There are quite a few cheap restaurants in the town center. Is there a particular cuisine you prefer?
I prefer creative food, please.
So sorry, I'm not seeing any creative restaurants. Will a different cuisine do?
How about one that serves indian food?
