I need a train from london liverpool street.
May I ask where you are travelling to? And what day?
Cambridge, on Wednesday.
Is there a certain time you would like to arrive in cambridge?
No. I just need to leave after 14:00.
I have train TR7978 leaving at 15:39 and arriving at 17:07. Would you like to book that?
Not right now, thank you. I'm also looking for a place to dine. I would like an expensive restaurant in the centre of town.
I have 33 restaurants available. Do you have a type of food preference?
