Hello, I am looking for an expensive place to eat in the centre of Cambridge.
There are many results in that area for expensive restaurants, is there a specific type of cuisine you'd like to try?
It should serve Chinese food.
We have four entries that match that criteria. Do you have a further preference?
Ok, I want to book a table for 5 people at 16:30 on wednesday.
I'm sorry, but I attempted reservations at your specified time at all 4 restaurants, and none have availability at that time. Would you like to try a different time?
How about 15:30?
I have a reservation for you at 15:30 for 5. Your reference number is JUGXYQOP and they will only hold your table for 15 minutes just an fyi. Anything else?
Yes, I also need a train for Wednesday I need to arrive by 12:30.
What are your departure and arrival stations?
I am leaving from london kings cross and going to cambridge. Arrival time as close to 12:30 as possible please.
