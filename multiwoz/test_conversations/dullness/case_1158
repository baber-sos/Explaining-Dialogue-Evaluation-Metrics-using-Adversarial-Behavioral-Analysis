Hi, can you give me some information on a place to stay when I arrive in Cambridge next week?
There are 24 guesthouses and 9 hotels across Cambridge. What type of place and price range are you looking for?
Not worried about the price but I would like a guesthouse in the east with free wifi.
The a and b guest house is in the east with free wifi. Would you like their address?
Yes, and may you please book a room in the hotel for 4 nights? It's for one person.
I can help you with that. What day will you be arriving at the hotel?
I will be arriving on Monday, I will need the reference number please.
