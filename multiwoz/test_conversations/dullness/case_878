Hi, I am planning a trip and need some recommendations for a place to stay while I am there.
Can I get an area you would like to stay in?
In Cambridge,I need a cheap guesthouse please
There are 9 cheap guesthouses. Is there a particular part of Cambridge you would like to stay in?
I don't really care. I do want a guesthouse with free WiFi, though.
How about the allenbell guesthouse located in the east. It is a cheap hotel with 4 star rating and free wifi and parking.
Is there one in the moderate price range with free internet?
Yes, there is. How many stars should the hotel be rated for?
Star rating does not matter to me.
Avalon is a moderate price guesthouse on the north side of town. Would you like me to book a room for you?
I don't need to book yet, but I would like the address.
the address is 62 gilbert road
Could I also get the phone number?
phone number to avalon guesthouse -01223353071
great, thank you. I would also like a place to go in the west
What kind of place would you like to go to? There are some colleges, some entertainment places, and some museums in the area.
Entertainment sounds great. Can you recommend something?
How about Whale of a Time? It's a great place to take children.
Actually, I'd like to go to a multiple sports attraction in the west if there is one?
