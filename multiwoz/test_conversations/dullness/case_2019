I need to arrive by 16:15 and I want to book it for 6 people.
I have one that leaves at 14:01 and arrives at 15:01. Would you like be to book that one?
Yes please, book that for 6 people and I need the reference number.
The booking was successful and your feference number is CJC7YKBL . May I help you with anything else today?
I am looking for a restaurant called The Lucky Star and would like to book the same six people there on the same day. Is that a possibility?
The Lucky Star is a Chinese restaurant on the south side falling in the cheap price range. I can try making a reservation for you; how many people in your party?
Like I mentioned previously, it'll be for the same 6 people, on the same day (Saturday), at 11:45 please.
Your booking was successful. The reference number is : PWSAA94F . Is there anything else I can help you with?
That will be all. Thank you for your help!
