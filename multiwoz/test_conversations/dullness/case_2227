I need some information on taking a train from Kings Lynn to Cambridge.
Sure, when are you planning to travel?
Wednesday, and can you please make sure I get there before 19:00. I don't want to miss Wheel of fortune.
The last train with ID TR3677 departing kings lynn to Cambridge on Wednesday will be the best option for you. It will depart by 17:11 and arrive by 17:58.
Thank you. What is the price for that train with ID TR3677?
They are 9.80 pounds each
Thank you. I am also looking for a multiple sports type attraction in the town centre. Can you tell me what is available?
I'm sorry I do not have any multiple sports locations in the centre of town.
