Hello. I need train to London liverpool Street.
Where are you departing from and do you have a time preference?
Yes, I'd like to leave Cambridge sometime after 12:15.
What day would you like to travel?
It would need to be on Thursday. Do you have anything?
I have one that leaves at 13:59 and 4 more that depart every two hours after.
The 13:59 will be fine, how much will a ticket cost?
A ticket for that train is 16.60 pounds.
And, please tell me what time the train arrives at london liverpool street.
The train will arrive at 15:27. May I book a ticket for you?
I'm also looking for things to do in town, what kind of attractions are there in the centre? I'd like the phone numbers, types, and fee information please.
There are many types, which do you like to see?
Any type is fine, can I just get the attraction type, entrance fee, and phone number of one?
