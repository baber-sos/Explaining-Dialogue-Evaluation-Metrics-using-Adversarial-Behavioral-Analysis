Hi, I'm looking for an expensive restaurant that serves Moroccan food in Cambridge please.
I'm sorry, there are no expensive Moroccan restaurants in Cambridge.
Ok, how about Chinese food then?
There are several. If you don't have a preference as to where in town you eat, might I suggest the good luck chinese food takeaway?
Is it in the expensive range?
Yes it is. Would you like me to send you their address?
Can you book me a table for one on Friday at 13:45? I will need the reference number as well.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : MM5BYTYE . Do you need anything else?
Yes, please. I'm looking for a hotel on the east side.
There are several, do you have any other preferences like price range or rating?
I would like it to be in the Expensive range.
There is one expensive hotel on the east side. It is the express by holiday inn cambridge. Would you like me to book that for you?
Yes, I'd like to book that for one person. It will need to be on Friday and I'll stay for three nights.
Your booking was a success! Your reference number is: YDTUA8PE .
