I am looking for a cheap place to stay.
We have ten cheap options, any preferences.
We will need free parking. Do any of the options have 4 stars?
Allenbell matches your requirements, would that work for you?
I need the hotel type, address and to know if they have wifi.
Allenbell is a guesthouse, located at 517a coldham lane. Yes, they do have wifi.
I'm also looking for a particular attraction. It's called trinity college
