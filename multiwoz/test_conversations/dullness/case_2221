Yo, I'm looking for a place to stay that's as awesome as me. four stars! It's gotta have free wifi, so I can do my social media, know what I mean?
I have many options for you - what's your price range or the area you're looking in?
I don't really have a price range. Anything is fine. I would like it to have free parking and wifi, though. And of course, 4 stars like I mentioned.
Do you have a preference for a hotel versus a guesthouse?
No, either will work just fine.
How about Archway House? It's located at 52 Gilbert Road.
That's great. Can you give me the area and price range, please?
Certainly! The Archway House is in the north area and has a moderate price range.
What's its address?
It's located at 52 Gilbert Road.
Thank you very much!
No problem. Anything else I can do for you?
