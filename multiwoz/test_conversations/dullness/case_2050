I am looking for aa train to cambridge that will depart after 16:45
Where will you be departing from?
I'll be leaving from leicester on Sunday.
There are 7 trains leaving Leicaster that fit your criteria. How does 17:09 sound?
That's sounds fine, could you let me know how much each train will cost?
Yes that ticket would be 30.24 pounds. Would you like me to book that for you?
No, thanks. I will go ahead and book later. I am also looking for a hotel room that is moderately priced.
What part of town are you wanting to stay in?
The place does not have to have free parking, should include free wifi, and should be in the centre of town.
The cityroomz meets all of your requirements. Would you like me to book that for you?
That won't be necessary. Could you just give me the postcode, hotel type, and what it's star rating is please?
