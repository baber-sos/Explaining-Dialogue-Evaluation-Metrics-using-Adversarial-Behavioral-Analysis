I'm looking for a place to stay. I'd like to stay in a guesthouse that doesn't need to include internet.
There are a total of 24 guesthouses available. Acorn Guest House has a 4 star rating, offers free wifi and free parking. Would you be interested in booking here?
Is that in the center of town? I do need to be in the center.
Acorn Guesthouse is not in the center, however I found two guesthouses that are. Alexander Bed and Breakfast is 4 stars. Would you like to book there?
Yes, please make my reservation at the Alexander Bed and Breakfast.
