Hi, I'm looking for restaurants in the area that serve British cuisine. Could you give me some suggestions?
There are many Indian restaurants in the city. Could you tell me in what area you would like to eat?
Is there something available in the west?
Yes, there are 3. Would you like something in the moderate or expensive price range?
