I'm looking for a hotel with free wifi and at least a three-star rating, please.
I listed these hotels, which one do you want me to book for you?
I would like a hotel that has free wifi and free parking. It should be moderately priced with a 3 star rating.
I have several options for you, ranging from cheap to expensive in price. Do you have a price range in mind, or perhaps a certain area of town?
Moderate priced anywhere in town please.
I unfortunately wasn't able to find anything that matches your request. Shall we look for a hotel that's a bit more expensive?
There aren't any 3 star hotels that offer free wifi and park that is moderately priced?
That's correct. There are three guesthouses that have your requirements. Would any of those interest you?
I am not particular. Where are they located?
The guesthouses are located in the south, north, and west end. Which do you prefer?
