Hello, I'm looking for a place to stay. I'd like it to be in the north and have zero stars.
The city centre north b and b matches your request. Would you like to book it?
Do they offer free parking?
Yes, they offer both free parking and free internet. Can I make a reservation for you?
I would like you to pick one, and tell em the adress and what type of room it is please.
There are at 328a Histon Road and it is a guesthouse. I will need the dates you want to stay in order to book it please.
I don't think I'll make that reservation just yet, but can you help me find an expensive restaurant in the same areas as the hotel?
Sure. do you have any kind of food preference?
Yes please make sure it is chinese and expensive price range.
I have two choices for you then, Hakka or The Hotpot. Do either of those sound good? I would be happy to book a reservation for you.
Let's try Hakka and can I get the reference number please.
I'll need some more information to make the reservation first. What day and time, and for how many people?
It'll be 1 people at 13:30 on thursday.
