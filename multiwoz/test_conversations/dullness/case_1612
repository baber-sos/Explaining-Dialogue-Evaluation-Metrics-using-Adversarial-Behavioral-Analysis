i need a place to stay
Sure. I'll need a little more information. Is there an area you are interested in?
No specific area. I would like it to be in the moderate price range and it should have free parking. I'd also like it to have 4 stars.
I have several options for you, most are located in the North area of town, is that acceptable? I can book one for you if you would like.
Yes, please book for 1 person and 4 nights starting from tuesday.
Ok. I booked the Acorn Guest House for you. The reference number is UWPC7AF0 . Would you like anything else?
Thanks for the booking. I would also like to see more of the west of Cambridge, particularly some type of an attraction.
There are 13 attractions to choose from in west Cambridge. Would you prefer a college, a museum, or an entertainment attraction?
Any of them would do, what would you recommend?
I would recommend the Churchill College is located on the west side of Cambridge and the entrance fee is free.
Great. I'd like a taxi to get there.
When would you like to arrive by?
