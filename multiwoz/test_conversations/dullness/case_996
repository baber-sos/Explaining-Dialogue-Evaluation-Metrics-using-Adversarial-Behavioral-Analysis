Are there any British restaurants in the centre?
Oh yes I have quite a few. Did you have a preferred price range in mind?
I'd like an expensive restaurant please.
I found three restaurants: Fitzbillies Restaurant, The Cambridge Chop House, or Midsummer House Restaurant. Would you like a table booked?
I want to make a booking at Fitzbillies Restaurant. It will be for 8 people on Friday at 12:00.
I am sorry but they do not have any seating for 8 people at that time. Would you like to try another day or time?
Can we make it for 11:00?
Sure, you're booked at 11:00 with reference number THSW3FKF . The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. May I help with anything else?
Thanks, that's all I need. Goodbye.
You're welcome. Enjoy!
