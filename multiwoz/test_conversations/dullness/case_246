I am coming to Cambridge and would like to see some architecture. Do you have any located in the centre?
Yes, there are 5 places located in the centre. I recommend the All Saints Church on Jesus Lane.
Thanks! What's the entrance fee?
There is no entrance fee, it is free. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I'd like to find a guesthouse to stay at. I want it to be nice, so I'd like an expensive one.
