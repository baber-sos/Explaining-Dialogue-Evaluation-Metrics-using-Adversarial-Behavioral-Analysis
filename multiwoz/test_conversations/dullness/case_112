Hello. I'm going out for an expensive dinner and need to find a restaurant. I'd like somewhere in the north, and I'm willing to pay quite a bit of money.
I'd be happy to help you with that. I have 5 expensive restaurants in the north. Did you have a type of cuisine in mind?
Yes, Romanian please.
There are no options for romanian, can I try something else for you?
I guess try European.
