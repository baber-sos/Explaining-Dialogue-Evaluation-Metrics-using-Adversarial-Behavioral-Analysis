am looking for a place to dine it should be in the centre and should be in the expensive price range
Were you looking for a specific type of food?
Yes, I am looking for a restaurant that offers vegetarian options.
I'm sorry but I do not have any vegetarian restaurants in the Centre area. Would you like me to search another area for you?
