I need to find a restaurant that serves Weish food in the centre of town please.
I'm sorry, but there are no restaurants that match your criteria. Would you like to broaden your search?
Yes, are there any Weish restaurants in the cheap price range that are in north Cambridge?
I'm sorry, but there are no welsh restaurants in all of cambridge.
Can you change my food preference to Chinese then? I still want to be in the cheap range and center of town.
I found 3 options for you: Charlie Chan at Regent Street City Centre, Rice House at 88 Mill Road City Centre, and Golden House at 12 Lensfield Road City Centre

That question does not make sense to me.
