I am looking for a brazliian restaurant in the centre.
Sorry, I couldn't find any food of that type.
There are no Brazilian restaurants anywhere in Cambridge?
No, their are not any. Would you like to pick a different type of food?
Yes, what about british food please.
what price range are you comfortable with?
Something in the moderate price range would be good.
Do you have a preference as to what area of town you dine in?
