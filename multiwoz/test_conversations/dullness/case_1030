I'm looking for a train departing from cambridge on wednesday.
Okay. What is your destination?
I am attending a seminar in Ely.
There are 10 trains on that route starting at 05:50. To make sure I book the right one what time do you need to arrive?
Well, I just want to leave after 9:15.
Alright, there are 8 options. The earliest train after 09:15 leaves at 09:50 and the latest at 23:50, each takes 17 minutes. Do you have a preference?
The 9:50 train will be fine. I'll need to book for 6 people. Can I please have the reference number?
Your tickets have been booked. Your total is 26.4 GBP and will be payable at the station. Your confirmation is 04Q2G0GU .
Great I also need a moderate priced place to stay with free wifi.
That gives us about 17 options. Is there a certain area in the city you prefer to stay in?
