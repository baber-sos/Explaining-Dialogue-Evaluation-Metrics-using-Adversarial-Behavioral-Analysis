Hello, I am looking to book a train that will be departing Cambridge after 13:15.
The first train leaves at 15:00 and they run every 51 minutes.
I'd like to go to Birmingham New Street on Thursday and leave after 13:45. Do you have anything that would work for me?
I have a train that leaves Cambridge 14:01 arriving in Birmingham New Street at 16:44. Would that work?

I don't have a good answer to that.
