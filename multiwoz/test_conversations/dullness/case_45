Hello, I'm trying to find a train to take me to London Kings Cross from Cambridge, are there any on that route?
We have many trains departing Cambridge for London Kings Cross, is there a particular day you are wanting to travel?
I want to leave on Saturday.
Thanks! Do you have a particular time you want to leave or arrive?
I would like to arrive in London at or just before 13:15, please.
The closest to that time is TR5170 which arrives at 11:51. Can I get you tickets for that?
What is the departure time?
That one departs Cambridge at 11:00.
What is the travel time?
51 minutes , Would you like me to book it for you ?
No thank you. Could you find me an attraction to go visit?
I'd be happy to! There is so much to do - did you have a particular type of attraction in mind?
No, but I would like something in the east.
What about the Cambridge Museum of Technology?
