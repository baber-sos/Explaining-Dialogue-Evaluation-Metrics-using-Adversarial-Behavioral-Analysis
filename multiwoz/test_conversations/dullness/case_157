I am looking for information. Can you help me find a place to stay? I want a hotel, not a guestroom.
What area and/or price range would you like? If neither of those matter, I recommend the Gonville, in the center of town.
Moderate would be a perfect price range.
Do you have any other criteria?
Yes, a 2 star rating would be great.
we have two at the note, do i recommend one?
Yes please do and book it for 5 people for 4 nights from Monday.
Ashley Hotel is a great hotel located in the north with free wifi and parking. If that sounds good to you, then I will go ahead and book it?
Yes please.
great! for how many people, which day, and for how long?
5 people for 4 nights starting from monday.
You are booked for the Ashley Hotel. Your reference number is FX8L2KID . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
I also need to book a taxi to commute between the two places.
Okay, where are you departing from?
Actually I am looking for the Corn Cambridge Exchange first.
