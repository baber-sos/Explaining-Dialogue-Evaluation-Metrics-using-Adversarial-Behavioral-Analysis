I am trying to find out about trains that arrive in Cambridge
There are quite a few trains coming into Cambridge. Where will you be departing from?
I want to arrive by 16:15
Okay. First, let's find out you're departing from.
I will be departing from stevenage and going to cambridge.
There's a train running every day leaving at 13:54 and arriving at 14:43. Did you have a particular day in mind?
I am looking to travel on Monday.
The latest train arrives by 14:43 would you like me to book that for you?
