Are there any trains on Wednesday that travel from Norwich to Cambridge?
There are several trains traveling from Norwich to Cambridge on Wednesday. Is there any particular time you are looking for? The earliest is 5:16.
The train should arrive by 14:30 please.
The TR118 arrives at 10:35. Does that work for you?
I think that will work. What is the departure time of that train?
That train leaves at 9:16. Would you care to book passage?
Yes please, can I get my train ID? I'm also want to look for a restaurant that serves Corsica with a moderate price range.
Your train ID is TR1180. Am I correct that you will only be needing one ticket?
I don't need a ticket right now. But can you tell me if there are any moderately priced restaurants in the center of town that serve corsica food?
I'm sorry, there aren't. Another type of food, perhaps?
Well, let's try a restaurant that serves international food. Still in the centre.
The Varsity Restaurant and Bloomsbury Restaurant are both moderately priced international restaurants in the center of town. Would you like a reservation at one of these?
Varsity Restaurant. Please make a reservation for 2 people at 18:15 on Wednesday.
