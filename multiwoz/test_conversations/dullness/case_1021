I'm looking for an Italian restaurant on the south side of town.
Sure we have either pizza hut cherry hinton or frankie and bennys. Would you like to book a table at one of these places?
Great! I'd like a table at Frankie and Bennys for 7 people at 14:00 on Friday.
I'm sorry, that time is not available. Would you like to book another day or time?
How about at 13:00 at same time?
Your table is reserved at 13:00 on Friday. Your reference number is RQ2L5TKR .
Great. That's all I need!
Thank you, let us know if you need anything else. Good bye.
