I am planning a trip and could use some help with the trains.
Ok, what day, what time, and where to and from?
I would like to leave on Tuesday departing from Cambridge and arriving by 14:15 at London Kings Cross.
The TR0315 arrives at 13:51. Do you want to book that trip?
Yes, please book me for 3 people, and can I get the reference number?
Your reference number is KHOLTDD9 . Can I help you with anything else today?
I am looking for a college located in the east.
There are no colleges in the east would you like to try a different area?
In that case, can you check and see if there is one in the type of boat?
Yes there is one. Camboats is located at the plough, green end, fen ditton.
