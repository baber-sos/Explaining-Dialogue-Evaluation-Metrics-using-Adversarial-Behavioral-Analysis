I am looking for a mexican restaurant in the centre.
I'm sorry, there aren't any Mexican restaurants in the centre of town. Would you like to try a different cuisine?
How about an Indian restaurant then?
There is the curry garden which serves indian food in the centre. Would you like to make a booking?

I don't know what you mean by that.
