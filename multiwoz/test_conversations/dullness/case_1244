I am looking for a place in Cambridge. It doesn't need to include internet and should be a hotel.
I was not able to find a hotel type with no internet, but there are hotels with internet.
Okay, that would be fine, as long as it has free parking.
Okay, do you have any preference on price range?
No. How many are available?
There are 8 different hotels around the city with free parking. Do you have a preference for city area or star rating?
It doesn't matter to me which part of the city it's in or it's rating. In your opinion, which one would be best for a short 3 day stay?
It's hard to say. How about the ashley hotel in the norht part of town?
Is there room for 4 people on Monday?
