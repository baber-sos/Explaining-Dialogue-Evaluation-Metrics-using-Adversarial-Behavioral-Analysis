i need info about the slug and lettuce restaurant.
Sure! The Slug and Lettuce serves gastropub type food. It's located in the centre and it's expensive. Would you like to book a table?
Absolutely, I need a table for 4 on Thursday, at 11:00 please.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : T7GL0FGT . Is there anything else I can help you with?
Thank you for the reference number. I'm also looking for places to go in the south side of town.
The south side has a lot going on. There's Ceneworld Cinema for movies, the place is a great nightclub and there are some museums in the area as well.
Thanks! will you give me an entrance fee for the nightclub?
I'm afraid that the entrance fee for The Place is unknown. Would you like information on another place?
No, that's okay. Thanks!
Thank you goodbye
