i am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should be in the east and doesn't need to include internet.
I like the Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge. It is 2 stars and expensive, really nice.
I would prefer a 4 star for my taste, and a guesthouse please
I have many to choose from. Would you like me to recommend one?
