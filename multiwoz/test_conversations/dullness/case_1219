I'm looking for a place to dine in the centre that serves jamaican food.
I'm sorry, I'm not finding any place that serves Jamaican food in the centre of town. Would you like to try another area?
That is fine, how about a place that serves Indian food?
There are several of those. Do you have a price range you are looking for?
I have no preference in price range.
I have 9 different indian restaurants in the centre of town. If you are looking for a truly authentic experience, might I suggest The Golden Curry. They are expensive.
That sounds perfect. Can you book a table for me for tuesday?
Sure. How many people will be dining on Tuesday?
I need the reservation for 2 people for 14:30 for Tuesday.
Okay, your table is booked for the Golden Curry and your reference number is SYL7B9MN .
Perfect. Also need to book a hotel, the autumn house for 2 people, 2 nights from Tuesday. If that day fails, then Wednesday and provide the reference number.
All right, your room has been reserved. Your reference number is VQQN0120 . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
No, that's all I need, thanks.
