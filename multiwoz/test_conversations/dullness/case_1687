Hi there. Can I get some help finding a hotel or guesthouse please?
Sure thing! What side of town would you prefer? What price range would you like?
I need one in the moderate price range. I would like one that doesn't have free parking.
There are 3 guesthouses and a hotel. Do you have a star rating that you enjoy staying at?
No not in particular.
I have four hotels. Do you know the area you would like to stay?
I'd prefer a guesthouse in the north, please.
I've got two options. The Alpha-Milton and the Avalon. Would you like me to book a room at either one?
Yes. The Apha-Milton sounds nice. Try that one, please.
I'd be happy to make your reservation for you. When would you like to arrive and how many are in your party?
There are 3 of us and we're arriving on Thursday. We'd like to stay for 4 nights if possible.
Your reservation is all set. Your reference number is 89S3ZAGS .
Thank you. That's all I need today.
You're welcome. Have a nice day.
