I am planning a trip in Cambridge,
How can I help you today?
I need to know what museums are in the area. Can you suggest one and let me know what area it is in please?
Is there a location preference?
I don't care what area it is. I was hoping you could make a recommendation.
What about the Byard Art museum in the south part of town?
Sounds great! I also need a train leaving on Thursday from London Kings cross.
Okay, there are 10 trains that meet your criteria. Would you like to narrow it down further by departure site or arrival time?
I need to leave after 14:15
TR5502 leaves at 15:17 and arrives 51 minutes later. How does that sound?
Yes. Please book of 3 people.

That question does not make sense to me.
