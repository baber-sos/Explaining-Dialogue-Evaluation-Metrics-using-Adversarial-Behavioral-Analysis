I am looking for a train that departs from Peterborough and goes to Cambridge.
I have many trains available. What day would you like to leave?
We will be leaving on Sunday afternoon.
There are still many trains to pick from, can you narrow down a departure and arrival time frame?
Yes, it should leave after 20:15 and leave on monday, not sunday. Please give me a price, travel time, and arrival time for any train.
I have one leaving at 20:19 and arriving at 21:09. It is 13.20 pounds. Would you like me to book that for you.
Yes please. What is the travel time? I'll also need a hotel in the expensive price range. Can you help me with that as well?
Travel time is 50 minutes. I found 5 hotels you may like. Do you have a star rating request or an area you prefer?
Yes, I'd like a 2 star rating and I'll need it to be in the east side of town.
I found one hotel that matches your criteria, It's the Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge. Would you like to book there?
Yes, I would like to book it for 3 people starting that same day for 4 nights.
I have you booked at the Express by Holiday Inn, three people for four nights starting on Monday. Your reference number is XPFOA5KT . Is there anything else you need?
