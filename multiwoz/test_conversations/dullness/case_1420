I am looking for a place to stay in the north of the city. I would prefer a 4 star hotel please.
There are several guesthouses available. Do you have a price reference?
No price preference needed
The home from home guesthouse hotel is located in the north, has a 4 star rating, and is moderately priced. Would you like me to book it for you?
Does it have free wifi?
How about the Avalon guesthouse?
I think that would be fine.
What day would you like to stay? How many days?
I would like it book for Sunday for 5 people and 3 nights. Can I have the booking number please.
The hotel is booked and your reference number is 0DJU3C37 . Can I help you with anything else?
I also need a train that departs from cambridge.
What is your desired destination?
I would like to visit Leicester on Wednesday.
There are 19 trains to Leicester on that day. Do you know what time you'd like to leave or arrive by?
I need to be in Leicester by 19:15.
Train TR1745 will get you there by 19:06. Do you want tickets for that?
I need the departure time for that train.
No problem! The departure time for TR1745 is 17:21. Will that work?
What is the price for that train?
