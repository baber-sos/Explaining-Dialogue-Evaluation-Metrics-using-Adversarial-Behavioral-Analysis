I am looking for a place in Cambridge. It doesn't need to include internet and should be a hotel.
I was not able to find a hotel type with no internet, but there are hotels with internet.
Okay, that would be fine, as long as it has free parking.
Okay, do you have any preference on price range?
No. How many are available?
There are 8 different hotels around the city with free parking. Do you have a preference for city area or star rating?

That question does not make sense to me.
