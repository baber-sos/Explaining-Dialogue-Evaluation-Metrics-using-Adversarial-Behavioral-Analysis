I am looking for a place to eat that's expensive and has Chinese food. Can you help me?
Sure. I have a number of different restaurants available. Do have a preference for the area?
I prefer a restaurant in the south.
You can choose from The Good Luck Chinese Food Takeaway or Peking Restaurant. Which would you like?
I would like the postcode on The Good Luck Chinese Food Takeaway
Sure! The postcode is cb17ag. Would you like to make a booking?
No, thank you. I also need a train to cambridge on sunday. Can you help with that?
I can. There are a lot of trains that meet that criteria. Would you like to narrow it down by departure location or departure time?
Yes, I'd like to go to leicester after 19:45.
