Hi, I am looking for some architecture to go to in the centre of town. Any ideas?
i'd like to suggest to you all saints church entrance there is free
Great, can I have the address and postcode?
Of course. The church is on Jesus Lane and the postcode is cb58bs. Can I help you with anything else?
I'm also going to need to catch a train into Cambridge for Sunday.
Where will you be departing from and what time would you like to travel on sunday?
I'd like to go from Cambridge to Ely, and I need to be there by 18:00 for a wedding I'm attending.
I have a train leaving cambridge to ely on sunday at 15:50 and you'll arrive by 16:07. Will that work for you?
Could you please tell me the train ID?
That would be the TR5713.
