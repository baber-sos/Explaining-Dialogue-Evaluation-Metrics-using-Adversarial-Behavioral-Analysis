I am looking for a place to dine. The restaurant should be in the expensive price range and should serve italian food
I have the cafe uno in the centre of town. Would that work?
No, I just realized I'll be in the south area. Are there any that meet my criteria in the south?
Yes, Frankie and Bennys is in the south and meets your criteria. Would you like me to make a reservation?
Yes could you book me a table for two Sunday at 11:15?
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : ZYQX1TYK .
Thank you so much for all of your help. Have a great day.
You are so welcome. Enjoy your meal.
