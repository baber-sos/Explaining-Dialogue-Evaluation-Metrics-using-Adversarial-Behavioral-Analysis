Can you help me find a 4 star expensive hotel?
The University Arms Hotel fits that description. Would you like me to book it for you?
Is that a guesthouse?
No sorry that is a hotel.
Is there a guesthouse available?
Unfortunately, there are no guesthouses that fit that description.
I would be interested in a guesthouse in the cheap price range if that is available. Will you check for me?
There are 7 available that match what you're looking for, do you have any preference for what area you want to stay in?
I need free internet and I need their postcode.
There is the Alexander Bed and Breakfast which has internet. It is located in cb12de postal code.
I also need a restaurant with south African food in the centre.
I am sorry there are no restaurants that match that description. Would you like to search for something else?
How about a restaurant that serves Italian food, do you have one that you would recommend?
