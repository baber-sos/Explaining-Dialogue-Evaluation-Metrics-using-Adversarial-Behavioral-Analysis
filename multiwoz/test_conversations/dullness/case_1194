I am traveling to Cambridge and am interested in trying local restaurants and finding a hotel for my stay.
There are many restaurants. Can you please elaborate on what you would like?
I need to find a hotel with a 3 star rating that includes free wifi.
I have 5 options for you, located all over town. Do you have a certain area or price range in mind?
I want chinese food in cheap price range in west side of town. A 3 star hotel that is expensive and includes wifi. Also the hotel address, area, and postcode please.
The Lensfield Hotel fits your request and is in the South. It is located at 53-57 Lensfield Road cb21en. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a cheap chinese restaurant on the west side.
Thanks for your help with the hotel. How about a restaurant in the centre that serves Indian food?
How about kohinoor. It is located at 74 mill road city centre with a cheap price range. Can I make a reservation for you?
What is the postcode and phone number?
The postcode is cb12as and the phone number is 01223323639. Would you like to make a reservation?
I also need a taxi from the restaurant to the hotel. I would like to leave the restaurant by 11:15.
