I am planning a trip in Cambridge
great, would you like some information?
I'm looking to go to Leicester. I want to leave on Sunday and arrive by 21:45.
Train TR9831 arrives in Leicester at 21:06, will that work for you?
That would be fine. I'll need the travel time, price, and train ID, please?
train id is TR9831 leaves at 19:21 and will cost 30.24 pounds
Thank you. Also i need to book a reservation at a restaurant named Nandos.
Okay, we have two Nandos. One in the south and one in the centre. Which would you prefer?
I'll go with the one in the centre. I need a booking for 8 at 16:45 on sunday.
Your table is reserved, reference #VIUNXVBC . Can I help you with anything else today?
That is all I need.
