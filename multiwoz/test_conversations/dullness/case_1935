Hi, what options are available in the south of Cambridge for upscale dining?
Is there a particular cuisine you are looking for?
I'm not picky, just let me know a few types of cuisine that are in the area please.
Peking Restaurant as well as The Good Luck Food Takeaway serve Chinese food. Taj Tandoori serves Indian, and Frankie and Benny's serves Italian. There is also a Mexican restaurant, Chiquito.
Frankie and Benny's sounds good. What is the phone number for that restaurant?
The phone number to Frankie and Bennys is 01223412430.
thank you. I also need a train to Cambridge arriving at 10:15 on Thursday.
