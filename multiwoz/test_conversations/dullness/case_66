I'm trying to get some information on the thanh binh restaurant please
That is a great inexpensive Vietnamese place in the West. Would you like their phone number?
i need a address and the area please ?
They are located on the west side and their address is 17 Magdalene Street City Centre. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I also need a train departing cambridge on thursday
I can look that up. Where are you headed out of Cambridge?
I'm heading into Norwich. I'd like to leave after 10:30, if possible.
The TR779 meets your criteria. Would you like to make a booking?
I sure would. I need 8 seats please.
I booked you 8 ticket on TR7779. Your reference number is MIKBIIZU . Can I help you with anything else?
That is all , thank you.
Thank you, enjoy your visit.
