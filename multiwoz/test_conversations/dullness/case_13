I'm looking for a restaurant called nandos. Are you aware of it?
I am. It is a great portuguese place. They have two locations in town. One in the South and on in the city centre.
Are you sure that they have two locations? Can you tell me their address(es)?
Nandos in the south is at Cambridge Leisure Park Clifton Way. Nandos City Centre is at 33-34 Saint Andrews Street. Do you need additional information?
Yes, I'm also looking for a hotel - the cambridge belfry?
The cambridge belfry 4 star hotel is a hotel in the west part of town in the cheap price range. Would you like any more information?
Yes their postcode and whether they have free parking or not.
The postcode for the nandos is cb17dy
You didn't answer my question. I need the postcode for The Cambridge Belfry and I need to know if they have free parking or not.
They do have free parking.
Okay, That is all I need ton know.
