Hello, I'm looking for some sports arenas to go to in Cambridge that's located in the centre. I like all different sports, so please tell me everything that is available.
I don't have any sports located in the centre. May I try a different area?
What about boats instead?
the cambridge punter is located in 251a chesterton road,cb41as. can i give you the phone number?
I don't need the phone number. Thank you.
Is there anything else I can do to assist you today?
I am also looking for any information you might have on Gonville Hotel.
The gonville hotel is an expensive 3 star hotel in the centre that offers free wifi and parking. Would you like a room?
Yes can you book that please?
Yes, I can. When would you like to begin your stay? How many people will be staying? How many days will you be staying?
Actually, I just need their phone number, please.
Their phone number is 01223366611
I'd also like to book a taxi to go between the two places.
What time would you like to leave or arrive by?
I need to leave the attraction by 6:15.
Where are you departing from? What is your destination?
I'm going to be headed from the Cambridge Punter back to the hotel.
Name of hotel please. I want to be sure to get correct destination.
