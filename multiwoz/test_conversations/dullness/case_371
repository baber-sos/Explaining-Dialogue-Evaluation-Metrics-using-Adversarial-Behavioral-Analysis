Hello, I'm looking for an attraction in the type of theatre.
There is the ADC Theatre, Cambridge Arts Theatre, Mumford Theatre, The Cambridge Corn Exchange, and The Junction. Which would you like to know about?
Could I get the postcode and entrance fee for the Mumford Theatre please?

I don't have a good answer to that.
