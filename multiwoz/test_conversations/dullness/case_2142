Yes hello! I'm looking for a train leaving on tuesday from norwich to cambridge.
There are a total of 133 trains traveling from Norwich to Cambridge. Is there a particular day that you would like to travel on?
I will travel on Tuesday to Cambridge from Norwich, and I need to arrive by 19:15.
Perfect. Did you have a departure time in mind? You could leave norwich as early as 05:16 or as late as 17:16 and still make it on time.
Earlier in the day is safer, thanks. I just need 1 ticket on the earliest ride.
I booked TR3932, reference number is FIW5ABO2 .
