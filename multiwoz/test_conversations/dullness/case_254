Hi, I need a train to Cambridge on Wednesday, please.
May I ask for your departure city?
I will be leaving from Stansted Airport and will need to get to Cambridge by 18:00.
I found a train that arrives at 09:52. Will that work?
That is very early, can i get one closer to 18:00?

I don't have a good answer to that.
