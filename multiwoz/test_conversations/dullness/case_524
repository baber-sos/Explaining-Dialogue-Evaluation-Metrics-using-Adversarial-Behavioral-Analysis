Hi, I'm looking for an expensive restaurant that serves Moroccan food in Cambridge please.
I'm sorry, there are no expensive Moroccan restaurants in Cambridge.
Ok, how about Chinese food then?
There are several. If you don't have a preference as to where in town you eat, might I suggest the good luck chinese food takeaway?
