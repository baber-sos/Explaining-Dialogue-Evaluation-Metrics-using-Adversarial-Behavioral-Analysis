Can you help me find a cheap place to stay in the east part of town?
Sure. There are three guesthouses there. I'd be happy to book one for you if you like.
Does it have a star rating of 2?
No. They all have 4 stars.
Then find me one in the expensive price range.
All of the accommodations in the East are in the cheap price range. Would you like to try a different part of town?
