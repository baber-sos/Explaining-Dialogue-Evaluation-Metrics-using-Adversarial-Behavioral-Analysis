Hi there. I'd like to find a place to dine in the city centre, preferable with Sri Lankan food. Do you have any recommendations?
Sorry, I don't have any restaurants with sri lankan food in the centre. Would you like to try another type of food?
Could you try again? Moderately priced, perhaps?
Sorry, there was nothing found. Do you want to try a different kind of food?
How about modern european food?
There are two options for modern european food in centre in the moderate price range. May I suggest Riverside Brasserie?
Sure! Could you tell me the address - including the postcode and phone number please?
Sure, they're located at the Doubletree by Hilton Cambridge Granta Place Mill Lane in postcode cb21rt. Their phone number is 01223259988. Can I help with anything else today?
Great. I am also looking for a guesthouse to stay in and I don't need parking.
