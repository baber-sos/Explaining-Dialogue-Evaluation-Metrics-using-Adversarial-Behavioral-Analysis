Can you help me find a place to stay that has a 4 star rating?
I can certainly help you with that. Do you have a preferred price range or area?
Thank you. I am looking for a hotel in the west part of town.
I have 3 in west - two are cheap and one is expensive. Preference on price?
I do not have a preference on price as long as it has a 4 star rating and is a hotel.
I would suggest the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel. It is very nice. Can I get you some information on it?
yeah, can you let me know if it has free parking?
Parking and internet are both included, would you like me to book you?
