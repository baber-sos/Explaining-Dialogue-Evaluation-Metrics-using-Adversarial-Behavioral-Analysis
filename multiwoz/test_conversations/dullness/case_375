Hi, can you help me find an architecture based attraction to go to?
There are 5 architecture based attractions in Cambridge. All in the centre of town. Would you prefer a church or a school?
Any church will be fine. Can you give me the phone number of one?
Certainly, All Saints Church's number is 01223452587.
Cool. I need a restaurant called the slug and lettuce too.
Would you like me to make a reservation at The Slug and Lettuce for you?
No thank you. Could you tell me what area of town The Slug and Lettuce is in, though?
That would be the center of town.
That's all I need. Thanks for your help.
