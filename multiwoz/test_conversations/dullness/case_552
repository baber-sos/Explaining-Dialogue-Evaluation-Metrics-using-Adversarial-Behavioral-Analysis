I am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should have a star of 2 and should be in the moderate price range
There are two such hotels in the north area. The first is the ashley hotel and the second is the lovell lodge. Do you have a preference?
I don't have a preference, actually. Which one do you recommend?
They both have internet and parking, so it is really up to you.
