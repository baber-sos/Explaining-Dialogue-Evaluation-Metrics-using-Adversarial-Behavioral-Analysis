I need to find a place to stay that includes free parking and is moderately priced.
I have many guesthouses and hotels available. Do you have a preference on the number of stars or location?
No star preference, but I would like it to be a hotel type.
There are two hotels that fit your criteria: the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge. Which would you prefer?
The Ashley Hotel will do fine. Can you book me a room there? It will just be myself staying.
How many days would you be staying there?
id be staying for 3 nights
Perfect, and what day will you be arriving?
I'll be arriving on Monday.
Booking was successful. Reference number is : TY5A2H5O . Is there anything else I can help with?
Yes, I'm interested in knowing what attractions are in the area as well.
