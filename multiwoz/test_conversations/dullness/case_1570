i am looking for a swimming pool in the south part of town.
I am sorry, there are no swimming pools located on the south side. Would you be interested in visiting a different attraction?
How about a cinema instead?
Cineworld Cinema in the south side is located at Cambridge Leisure Park, Clifton Way CB17DY and their phone number is 00872208000. Is there any other information I can get you?
What's the postcode and enterance fee?
Unfortunately I don't have any information on the entrance fee. The postcode is cb17dy. Can I help you with anything else?
I am also looking for a restaurant that serve portuguese food in the south side of town.
Nandos meets your criteria. Would you like to book a table?
