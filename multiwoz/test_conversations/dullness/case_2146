Hi, I need to catch a train from Stevenage to Cambridge.
I can help you with that. What day will you be traveling?
I need to leave on Wednesday and arrive no later than 21:45.
I have train TR4015 that leaves at 19:54,and arrives at 20:43. Is that to your liking?
How long will that trip take?
The travel time for that train is 49 minutes
Thanks. Can you tell me anything about the castle galleries attraction?
Sure it is a lovely museum located in the centre, and the best part is it is free to get in!
Could I please get the phone number for that?
the phone number is 01223307402
That's perfect, thanks!
You're welcome! Is there anything else you need help with today?
No that is it. Thank you!
