Hi, I need a guesthouse with free wifi please.
I have 33 guesthouses with internet, which area would you prefer?
I also need free parking, and I'd prefer a 4 star place.
You do have a few options, including the Alexander b&b which offers free WiFi as well as free parking. It is also inexpensive, and rated 4 stars.
Great. Can you book that one for 4 nights checking in on Tuesday? There will be 6 people.
OK, the booking was successful. Your reference number is 5CB11JQ8 . Is there anythng else I can help you with today?
