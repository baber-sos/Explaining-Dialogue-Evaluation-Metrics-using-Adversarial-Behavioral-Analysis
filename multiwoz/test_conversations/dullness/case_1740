i am looking for a particular attraction. Its name is called the fitzwilliam museum.
The Fitzwilliam museum is located in the area of centre. Their phone number is 01223332900. There is no entrance fee. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Can you send me the postcode please?
Their postcode is cb21rb
I'm also looking for a cheap hotel to crash in. Can you find one for me?
