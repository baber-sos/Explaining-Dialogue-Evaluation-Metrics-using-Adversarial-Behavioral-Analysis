I need to get to London Kings Cross. Can you help me find a train?
I have 70 trains matching your request. Is there a specific day and time when you would like to travel?
The train should arrive by 15:45 and should leave on Friday from Cambridge.
There are 5 trains. Would you like to leave at 5:00?
Sure, that would work. How much would that cost, and how long would the travel time be?
The price is 23.60 pounds, and the duration is 51 minutes. Would you like to book this train?
Yes please! Can you also recommend some places to go in the west?
There are 5 attractions in the west. What type of attractions were you looking for?
Any type is fine can I just get the address of one please?
Sure. Let's go with queens' college. That is located on silver street.
Okay great! Thank you for your help.
Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
No, that's all thank you.
