I have several choices, do you have a time for your departure?
I am looking for a train arriving in Peterborough.
And where will you be leaving from?
I'll be leaving Cambridge on Sunday.
I have train TR1086 that leaves at 16:06 and will have you in Peterborough at 16:56. Would this work for you?
Yes, that will be fine can you get me a ticket?
How many tickets will you need?
I need 7 tickets.
I've booked you 7 tickets on the TR1086. Your reference is IJ6ZQ2GF and the total fee of 92.4 GBP is payable at the station. Can I help you with anything else?
