I'm so bored, can you find me some kind of entertainment in the city centre please?
I'm sorry, there are no entertainment attractions in the centre of the city. Would you like to try a different area of the city?
What about a nightclub somewhere?
Sure, there are plenty of those in the centre. I'd recommend Kambar, located at 1 Wheeler Street. Can I get you more information?
