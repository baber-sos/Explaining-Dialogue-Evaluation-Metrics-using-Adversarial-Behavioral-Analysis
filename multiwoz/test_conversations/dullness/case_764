Let's go with the train first. I'm looking for one that leaves after 16:30 on saturday.
From where and to where will you travel?
I would like to leave cambridge to bishops stortford
I have one leaving at 17:29, arriving in Bishop's Stortford at 18:07. Does that work?
Yes, I'd like three tickets, please.
Great. I have booked those seats for you and your reference number is JAVMFJGM . Is there anything else I can do for you?
No that will be all for now.
Thank you for using our service. Have all of your needs been met?
Yes they have. Thanks.
