I would like to find a hotel that has free wifi.
Do you have a area of town or price range your interested in?
I do not have a specific area or price.
The arbury lodge guesthouse is one of 32 options for you.
Will it fit 8 people?
Yes, all of the hotels and guesthouses are able to accommodate 8 guests per booking. Are you ready to book? If so, I just need a little more info.
