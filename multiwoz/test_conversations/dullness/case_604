I would like a british food restaurant in the centre.
Sure, there are 7 restaurants that meet your needs. 4 are moderate and 3 are expensive. Do you have a preference?
Only the best for my family .. we'll take the expensive one. Book us a table for 5 at 14:00 on Thursday.
I'm sorry I am having difficulty making a reservation for you. Shall we try another time or restaurant type?
Let's try Italian instead.
Caffe Uno is a very nice, expensive Italian restaurant in the center of town. Would you like a table there?
Actually, I change my mind. I think I want to stick with British food after all. Can you suggest any one thats in the centre of town?
Fitzbillies Restaurant, the Cambridge Chop House, and Midsummer House are all centrally located, british, and very expensive, but none have a table for 5 available on Thursday at 14:00.
Can you try the Cambridge Chop House for Thursday for 5 people at 13:00 instead?
Your reservation at the Cambridge Chop House for 5 people at 13:00 on Thursday was successful. Your reference number is U6GV5ZZV . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
