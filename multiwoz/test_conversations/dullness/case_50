Hi, I am looking for information about the Warkworth House hotel.
Is there anything specific you'd like to know about the Warkworth House hotel?
I just would like to book it for 2 people, for 5 nights, beginning Monday. Please give me reference number.
Your room has been booked successfully. Your confirmation number is ARWOR7QP . Would you like help with anything else?
I am also looking to book a train to norwich.
What day are you looking to depart?
I would like to leave on Saturday from Cambridge to be in Norwich before 21:00.
TR4018 leaves cambridge at 17:36 and arrives at 18:55. May I book it for you?
Thank you so much. So that means a 79 minute travel time? Let's go ahead and book it.
