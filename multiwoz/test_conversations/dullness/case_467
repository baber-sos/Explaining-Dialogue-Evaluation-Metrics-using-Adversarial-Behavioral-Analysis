Could you help me with planning my trip? I need a train.
I can absolutely help you. Can you tell me your departure and arrival stations?
Yes, on Sunday I'll be departing from Cambridge and going to Stevenage. I'd like to leave after 17:00.
Train TR7729 would probably fit your needs. It leaves at 17:21.
Can I book the train for 4 people please? And can AI get a reference number?
Okay. Your reference number is 2OJ4IDVL . Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes, I'm look for a places to go while I'm in town. Could you find me an attraction in the east part of town?
There are ten attractions in the east. Do you have a type of attraction you want to see?
Can you make a suggestion?
Sure the funky fun house is entertainment in the east.
