I've got a particular restaurant we want to try, but I will need some help with it.
I'd be happy to help, what is the name of the restaurant you want to try?
I'm looking for a pizza hut city centre.
I am familiar with it. It is on Regent Street. Do you need a reservation?
Can I get the area of town and the price range pleas?
