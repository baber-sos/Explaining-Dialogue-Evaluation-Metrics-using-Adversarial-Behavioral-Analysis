I need to find a particular train that will arrive at 16:30 and will leave on Saturday. I would appreciate it if you could help me.
There are 229 trains that meet your criteria. What are your departure and arrival stations?
I'm coming from Peterborough and going to Cambridge.
TR6886 departs at 06:48 and arrives 07:38. Will that work for you? I can book it if you are interested.
Yes please, can you make the reservation for 7 people and then send me the reference number.
Ok. I've booked that for you. Your reference number is 2K7LO41G . Can I help you with anything else?
