I'm looking for a place to dine in the centre.
There are many restaurants in the centre of town, do you have a preference of food?
Is there anywhere that serves middle eastern food?
Unfortunately there is not. What else may I check for you?
Is there anywhere in the centre that serves mediterranean food?
I've found three options, sir. May I ask what type of price range were you looking for?
I'd like something in the expensive price range.
There are two expensive Mediterranean restaurants in the centre of town--La Mimosa and Shiraz.
book either for me
I recommend la mimosa, great word of mouth. What day and time do you want to dine? How many will be going, please?
Can we do Saturday at 15:00?
