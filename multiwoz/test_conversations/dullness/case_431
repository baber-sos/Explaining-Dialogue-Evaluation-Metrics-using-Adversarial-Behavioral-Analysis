Please help me find a restaurant.
I can definitely do that. Did you have a type of food or a price range in mind?
Moderately priced Northern European cuisine, please.
I'm sorry I have no listings for moderately priced Northern European cuisine. Could you reconsider your price range or food type?
Sure, can you find me another restaurant that serves Indian food?
I have many what area can I look in?
Any area of town is fine.
Would you still like a restaurant in the moderate price range? I would recommend the Curry Prince.
Yes. May I have the post code for that place?
The post code is cb58jj.
