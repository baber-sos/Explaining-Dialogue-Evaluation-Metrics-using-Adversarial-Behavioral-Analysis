I feel like spoiling myself so find me an expensive place to eat in the centre
What is your favorite kind of cuisine?
Lets try some halal food?
I'm sorry, but I could not find any listings for restaurants serving halal style food. Do you have any other favorite types of cuisines?
Ok, well how about african food?
Bedouin is an African restaurant in the centre. It's expensive, but I hear it's great. Would you like me to book it for you?
Yes that would be wonderful. Could you reserve for 6 people at 17:15 on Monday?
It is all booked, reference number is HYTD7MDQ
