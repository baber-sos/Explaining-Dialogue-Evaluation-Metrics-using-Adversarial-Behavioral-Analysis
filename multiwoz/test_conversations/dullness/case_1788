I am looking for an expensive hotel with free parking.
We have 5 places that offer all of that. Any preference on star rating or area?
No, that's not important to me. But, I would prefer to stay in a guesthouse with free parking.
Sorry, there are no guesthouse type expensive places with free parking. Perhaps you'd prefer a different type or price range?
