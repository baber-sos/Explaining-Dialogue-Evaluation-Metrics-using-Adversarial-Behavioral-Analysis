Can you help me find the funky fun house?
The Funky Fun House is located at 8 Mercers Row, Mercers Row industrial estate. Would you like the phone number?
Please give me their postcode, and the area of town they are located in.
It's on the East side and the postcode is cb58hy. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I would like a place to eat in the centre and should serve korean food.
I would recommend Little Seoul. Would you like to make a reservation?
Yes, can you please do that for me.
