Can you help me find a place i am looking for? Its name is the Jesus Green outdoor pool.
Sure, the address is between Victoria Road and the River, the postcode is cb43px. Would you like their phone number for directions?
Great, thank you, and to be sure, this is actually a pool, correct?
Yes, it is listed as a swimming pool in the northern part of town. Is there anything else I can help you find today?
Yes, I'm also looking for a restaurant Can you help me with that, too?
Sure, what is your price range?
Expensive, it should be in the centre and serve chinese food.
I have found 4 Chinese Restaurants in Centre; Ugly Duckling, Tang Chinese, HK Fusion, and Seasame Restaurant and Bar. Would you like there phone numbers, or address?
I am more interested in booking whichever will accept a table of four at 18:30 this Wednesday?
Sir, I'm afraid none of those restaurants have a table available for that time period. Do you want to try a different day or time?
Yes, could you try 17:30 instead please?
I was able to book you for that time at the Ugly Duckling located at 12 St. Johns Street City Centre. Your reference number is V7BJ4WDN . Is there anything else?
No I think that's all, thank you
You're very welcome. Have a great day and text us back anytime!
