I'd like to find a hotel with free wifi and free parking, please.
I can help you find this information! Did you have a particular area of town in mind?
Cambridge, in the east with a 4 star rating I am sparing no expense.
There are lots of 4 star lodgings, but they are all guesthouses rather than hotels, and they all have cheap or moderate prices. Would one of those be okay?
Yes I just am looking to get the phone number of one.
Allenbell's phone number is 01223210353.
