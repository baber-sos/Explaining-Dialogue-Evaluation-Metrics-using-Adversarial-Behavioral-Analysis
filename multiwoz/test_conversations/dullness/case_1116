Hello, I'd like some information on a restaurant today.
There are 110 restaurants in Cambridge. To help narrow down results, is there a particular type of food you are looking for?
Let's try international food.
Sure, do you care if it is cheap or moderately priced?
Moderately priced in centre. I would like to book a table for 2 at 18:45 on Sunday
The varsity restaurant may have availability.
