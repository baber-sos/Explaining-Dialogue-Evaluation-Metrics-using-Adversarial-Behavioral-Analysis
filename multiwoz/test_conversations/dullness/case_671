I'm going to be in the area soon to try some restaurants, but I'm having trouble finding information on one in particular.
I have a vast array of restaurants. What type of food would you like, how much do you want to spend and what area would you like?
iM LOOKING FOR THE peking restaurant WHAT TYPE OF FOOD DOES IT SERVE AND I ALSO NEED THE ADDRESS
It is an expensive Chinese restaurant located at 10 Homerton Street City Centre. Is there anything else you need?
A hotel in the centre with free wifi, please.
There are 5 to choose from, from cheap to expensive. Do you have a price preference?
Yes, can I please get something in the moderate price range?
