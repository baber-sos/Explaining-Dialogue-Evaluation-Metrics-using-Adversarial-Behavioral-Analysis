What are your departure and arrival stations?
I want to go birmingham new street from cambridge.

I have booked you 4 tickets on TR7728. Your reference number is 3USY2KMX . I hope you have a great trip and can I assist you with anything else?
Yes, I'm also looking for information on the Lensfield Hotel.
Yes what would you like to know? The Lensfield is an expensive hotel with free wifi and parking on the city's south side.
Okay, thanks! Can you please book it for the same group of 4 people for 2 nights, starting Saturday?

No, that's all. good bye.
