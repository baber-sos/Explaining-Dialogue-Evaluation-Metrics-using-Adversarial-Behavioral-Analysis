I need to find a swimming pool in the south area of Cambridge.
There aren't any swimming pools in south Cambridge. Do you to expand your search to different areas or other types of attractions?
Is there a type of cinema?
Yes! I have one called Cineworld. Would you like their telephone number.

Cineworld Cinema's phone number is 00872208000. Unfortunately, I am unable to view their entrance fee. Did you also need the address?
No, I don't need the address. You can however help me find a train that leaves for Kings Lynn after 09:45
