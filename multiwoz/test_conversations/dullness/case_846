I am looking for some where to go, in the centre of town.
Do you have an idea of what type of attraction you would be interested in?
Yes, I would like to visit a park, please.
The Cambridge University Botanic Gardens is located in the city centre. Would you like the address?
Yes, that would be great. I will need a train also.
The address is bateman street cb21jf. May I ask where you'll be traveling via the train?
I need the train to go to Broxbourne.
Ok, what day are you traveling?
I'm traveling on Saturday.
I have several trains available for Saturday. What time would you like to leave Cambridge and arrive in Broxbourne?
I would like to arrive in Broxbourne by 09:15 from Cambridge. I will need a departure time too, please.
TR7807 will leave Cambridge at 8:01 and arrive in Broxbourne at 9:01. If that works for you, I can go ahead and get you a ticket.
