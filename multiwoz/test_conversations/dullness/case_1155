Are there any parks in town, by chance?
There is one in the centre, one in the east, one in the north and two in the south. Will one of these work for you?
Could I get the address for the one in the centre?
Sure. The Cambridge University Botanic Gardens are located at Bateman Street.
i need its address and phone number.
The address is Bateman Street, postcode cb21jf and the phone number is 01223336265.
Thanks. I also need a place to get afternoon tea in the west.
There are no restaurants serving afternoon tea in the west.
How about Italian restaurants?
Yes I have two choices. One in the cheap price range and one that is priced moderately. Do you have a preference?
I don't have a price preference. Which would you suggest?
Actually, I really like the la margherita - it's cheap but tasty. Would you like me to book it?
Yes, I need it for Friday, 20:00, for 7 people. I need a reference number. I need a taxi betweentwo places before 20:00. Contact # and car type?

Thanks, please also help me find a taxi.
Okay! From where to where?
