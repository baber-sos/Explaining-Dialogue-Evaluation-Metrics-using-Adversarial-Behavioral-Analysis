Can you help me find a cheap place to stay in the east part of town?
Sure. There are three guesthouses there. I'd be happy to book one for you if you like.
Does it have a star rating of 2?
No. They all have 4 stars.
Then find me one in the expensive price range.
All of the accommodations in the East are in the cheap price range. Would you like to try a different part of town?
find me a nice one and book for 5 people and 3 nights from thursday
Actually, the Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge is a 2 start hotel in the east area. It's in the expensive price range. How does that sound?
That sounds perfect. Can you reserve that and provide me with the reference number?
Okay, you're all set. The hotel is booked and the reference number is Q3VVCAD8 . Can I help you with anything else today?
Thank you. I am also looking for a restaurant that serves Chinese and that is in the same area as the hotel.
Yu garden is an expensive restaurant in the same area as the hotel, would you like me to make reservations for you?
Yes. Same group of people, at 19:45 on the same day please.
