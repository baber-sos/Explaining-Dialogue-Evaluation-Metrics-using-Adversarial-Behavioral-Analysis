I am planning a trip in Cambridge.
and what would you like to do ?
I keep hearing about this great museum called the Fitzwilliam. Can you tell me a little about it?
Sure, it's located on Trumpington Street. The admission is free. Would you like their phone number?
Yes, please.
Their phone number is 01223332900. Will that be all?
