Hi, I am looking for a train. Can you help me, please?
Where do you need to go?
I need to go to bringham new street by 17:30
OK, what day are you traveling, and do you need to leave or arrive by 17:30?
I am traveling on sunday and need to arrive by 17:30 coming from cambridge
I have 10 routes that might work for you, leaving hourly from 05:01 to 14:01. I'd recommend TR6908 which arrives at 16:44. Would you like to book?
Please give me their travel time and price of TR6908.
Sure, the travel time is 163 minutes, and the price is 60.08 pounds. May I help with anything else?
