Hi, I am planning a trip and need some recommendations for a place to stay while I am there.
Can I get an area you would like to stay in?
In Cambridge,I need a cheap guesthouse please
There are 9 cheap guesthouses. Is there a particular part of Cambridge you would like to stay in?
I don't really care. I do want a guesthouse with free WiFi, though.
How about the allenbell guesthouse located in the east. It is a cheap hotel with 4 star rating and free wifi and parking.
Is there one in the moderate price range with free internet?
