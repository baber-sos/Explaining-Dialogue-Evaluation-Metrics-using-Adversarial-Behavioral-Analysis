I'm looking for a place to go in Cambridge. Perhaps an architecture attraction.
There are 5 architecture attractions in the centre. WIll one of those work?
Yeah, could you recommend me one?
Holy Trinity church is beautiful.
Could you tell me what area it's in, and if there's an entrance fee?
It is in the centre of town.
Is there an entrance fee?
No, they have free entry there. Is there anything else I can help with?
