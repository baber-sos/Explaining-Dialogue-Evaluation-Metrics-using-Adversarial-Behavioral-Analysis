I am looking for a hotel in the north.
We have two hotels in the north, and eleven guesthouses. Do you have a preference?
I want one of the hotels in the moderate price range please.
Both of the hotels that I found are in the moderate price range. Would you like for me to book one for you?
Which one of them has free parking?
Fortunately for you, they both offer free parking. The Ashley hotel and the Lovell lodge are both available for you. Would you like to make reservations at one?

I don't know what you mean by that.
