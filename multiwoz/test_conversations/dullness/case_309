Hi. I am having trouble finding a place to eat called prezzo. Can you locate it for me and tell me a little about it please?
Prezzo is located at 21 - 24 Northampton Road, in the west. It's an italian restaurant. Moderate price range.
That sounds perfect!
Would you like me to book you a table?
Not this time but I would like to visit an attraction while in Centre, can you find one for me?
Okay, there's about 44 attractions in the centre of town. Is there something in particular you'd like?
no, but I will need the address.
I think you would enjoy Old Schools in the centre of town. It is an architectural attraction. The address is trinity lane.
