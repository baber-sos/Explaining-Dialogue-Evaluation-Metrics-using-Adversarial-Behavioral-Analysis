I am traveling to Cambridge and looking forward to try local restaurants.
Glad to hear you're coming for a visit! What type of food do you like? I can help you find a great one.
I would like to find a train first. I need one on Sunday going to kings lynn.
I would be happy to assist you. Let's clarify your departure and destination points. Are you travelling from Cambridge to Kings Lynn?
Yes, that's correct. I need to arrive in Kings Lynn by 13:00.
TR5507 leaves cambridge for kings lynn on sunday at 12:11. Would that work for you?
Yes, that should work. Could you give me the price?
The cost is 7.84 pounds.
Thanks! Can you also tell me if there are any expensive Mediterranean restaurants in the center of town?
I see two Expensive Mediterranean Restaurants in the town centre. La Mimosa and Shiraz Restaurant, do you have a preference?
La Mimosa and can you book it for me and get a reference number ?
Yes I can book it for you. How many people will be dining and what time and day?
I'm sorry, I don't need it booked anymore. I just need the address, postcode, and phone number please.
The address is Thompsons Lane Fen Ditton with a phone number of 01223362525. The postcode is cb58aq.
