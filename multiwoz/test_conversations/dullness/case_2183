Hi, could you help me with my plans? I am looking for a train.
I can help you with that. Where will be departing and where do you want to go?
I will be departing from Cambridge and going into Ely on Saturday.
Trains run that route every two hours throughout the day. Do you have a target departure or arrival time?
I would like to arrive in Ely by 11:15. Could you please tell me the price and what the departure time is?
TR0718 arrives at 10:07 on saturday. Cost is 3.52 pounds. Would you like me to reserve a seat for you?
I need to book a room in the North as well.
There are 2 hotels and 11 guesthouses to choose from in the north, ranging in price from cheap to moderate. Do you have a price point preference?
I would need a hotel with wifi
There are 12 hotels that fit your criteria. Do you want a moderately priced or cheap hotel?
I don't care about the price. I absolutely do need free parking, though.
Do you have a star rating preference?
I do not have a preference on the number of stars.
