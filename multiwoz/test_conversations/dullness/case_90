Please find me a place to dine that serves vegetarian food that's in the expensive price range.
Oh dear. I did a search for a cheap vegetarian restaurant and my computer doesn't list one. Would you like me to check the moderate range?
I am actually wanting the restaurant to be expensive and in the centre of town.
I am sorry but there are no restaurants matching that criteria. Would you like to try another price range or part of town?
Are there any expensive french restaurants in the centre?
Yes, one of my favorites. Cote on Bridge Street City Centre.
