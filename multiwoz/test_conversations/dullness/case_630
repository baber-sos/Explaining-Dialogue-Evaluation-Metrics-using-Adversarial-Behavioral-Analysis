Please help me find a hotel called Flinches Bed and Breakfast. Thanks.
It's phone number is 01223276653 and is located in postcode cb30nd
Thanks. I'd like to book a room for 6 people, for two nights on thursday.
You're all set. Your booking was successful and your reference number is VMI0R4J4 . Anything else I can help with?
We will also need to catch a train that is going to Cambridge. Any trains that will put us in Cambridge by 12:00?
There are many trains that will fit your schedule. Where will you be departing from and will you be traveling on Thursday?
I'll be departing from leicester on Thursday.
I'm sorry, there are not trains leaving leicester on thursday. Would you like me to look on another day?
How about train stations near leicester?
Do you know what they would be called?
No. thank you. Goodbye.
Your welcome. It has been a pleasure assisting you today. Goodbye
