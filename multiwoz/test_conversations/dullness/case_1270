I am looking for a place to stay. Could you find me a place in the centre of town that is expensive?
There are 2 hotels in that area that are in the expensive price range, one is a 3 star and the other 4 star. Which one would you prefer?
I need it to have free wifi and free parking. Does one of them offer both?
Yes, they both do. May I recommend Gonville hotel?
Absolutely, can you provide me with the postcode and hotel type of the Gonville hotel?
Sure, the postcode is cb11ly. Can I book a room for you?
No thank you. I am needing a train that will leave on wednesday and arrive by 13:15.
I will check to see if I can find a train that matches your needs.
Thanks. I'll be heading from Broxbourne to Cambridge.
