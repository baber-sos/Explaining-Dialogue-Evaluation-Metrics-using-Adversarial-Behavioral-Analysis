I'm looking for European restaurant in the centre.
I see there are several, can you make a recommendation?
I haven't tried any in that area before. What would you suggest?
I have the eraina that is expensive or the riverside brasserie which is in the moderate range.
Can I get the phone number and postcode for eraina, please?
Their phone number is 01223368786, and postcode is cb23rh.
