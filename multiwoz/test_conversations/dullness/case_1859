Please see what you can find out about jesus college
It is a college in the town centre, address Jesus Lane. Postcode is cb58bl and it has free admission.
Do you happen to have the telephone number for the college? I would like to call the main office there.
I can certainly look that up for you. Ok, it's 01223339485. Do you need any more information or something else I can help with?
Thank you. I'm also looking to leave on Tuesday by train. Arrival will be Stansted Airport.
