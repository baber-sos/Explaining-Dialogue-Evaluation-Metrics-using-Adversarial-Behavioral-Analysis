Hi, I'd like to find some place to go in the east. What's good to visit?
There are several places would you like an entertainment attraction or a museum?
Can't you suggest something please? I need the address, attraction type and postcode when you find it please.
How about Cambridge Artworks? It's a museum on the east side of town, and they have no entrance fee.
That sounds great. What's their address and postcode?
Their located at 5 greens road and postcode cb13ef.
Thank you. Can you book a train for me? I'm leaving on Monday and I would like something that arrives by 12:15.
Could you tell me where you are leaving from and want to arrive at?Thank you.
I'm leaving from kings lynn and going to cambridge.
I'm sorry there are no trains matching that description. Would you like me to search for something else?
Can you check again please for anything arriving before 12:15
Train TR0942 Leaves Kings Lynn at 09:11 and arrives in Cambridge at 9:58. Would you like me to book this train?
Yes please, thank you.
