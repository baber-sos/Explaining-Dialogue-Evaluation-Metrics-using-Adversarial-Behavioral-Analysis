I'm looking for an attraction in the west.
There are 13 attractions in the west, mostly colleges and museums. Is there a price range we need to keep in mind?
No, nothing in particular. Please pick out one you might enjoy and we will try that. If you would include the phone number that would be helpful, thanks!
Churchill college is located at Storey's Way. It is free of charge. Can I provide further assistance?
Please give me their phone number.
Sure, their phone number is 01223336233. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
I also need a train that leaves from broxbourne and goes to cambridge on Monday, leaving after 12:15.
TR0354 departs at 12:32. Would you like to book a ticket on that one?
Actually, yes but I will need a total of 6 tickets please.
Great! Booking was successful, the total fee is 107.4 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : DNOD8R84 .
That is all I need, thank you.
Isd there anything else ?
