I'm planning a trip to Cambridge and am looking for a place to dine.
There are many great places to dine in Cambridge. To help narrow it down, what area are you looking for and what type of food?
I'm looking for an Italian restaurant in the north.
I have one place. Would you like me to book it?
Sure, I need a table for 4 on Saturday at 16:00 please.
Here is your booking information:Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : B162FV8D .
Thanks I also need a train leaving Sunday from Cambridge to Norwich leaving after 13:00.
I have 11 trains available. What time would you like to arrive?
i would just like the train leaving the closest after 13:00.
The closest one is TR8185 it leaves at 13:36 would you like me to book it for you?
