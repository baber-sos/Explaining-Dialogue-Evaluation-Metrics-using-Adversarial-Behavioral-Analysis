Hi, I'm looking for a train that departs from Cambridge and arrives at Kings Lynn.
When will you be traveling?
I'll be traveling on Friday. I want to arrive by 19:15 if possible.
i suggest TR3947. can we book?
Can you give me the price, travel time and departure time first?
I actually fount the TR2764 to be a better choice. It leaves at 08:11 to and arrives at 08:58 at a cost of 9.80 pounds.
Yes but what is the exact travel time?
Your travel time would be 47 minutes. Would you like me to book your seat on the train?
Not right now, but I am interested in seeing some attractions while I am in town.
