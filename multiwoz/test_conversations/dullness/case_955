Hi. Can you help me find a train?
Sure. Where will you be departing from and where do you want to go?
I want to depart from leicester and go to cambridge. I also want to leave on saturday
What time would you like to leave?
I need to leave after 13:45. Can you help find something?
I have the TR0137 leaving at 14:09. Would you like me to book that for you?
Yes that will be fine, can you book me a seat for 2 people and give me the reference number?
I have booked you on the TR0137 for two people with reference number is A4MGZVE0 . The total fee is 60.48 GBP payable at the station. Will that be all?
Actually, I could use some help finding an expensive restaurant in the west part of town.
I have 9 restaurants that meet your requests. Would you be interested in British, European, Indian, or Thai cuisine?
I would like european, please
