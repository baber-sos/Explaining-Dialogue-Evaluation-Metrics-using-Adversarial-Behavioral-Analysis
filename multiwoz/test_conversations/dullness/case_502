I am looking for an expensive restaurant in the centre.
What type of food would you like to eat?
I would love to try some African food.
Bedouin would be the perfect place for you to dine. They're located at 100 Mill Road City Centre. Do you need additional information about them?
No thank you. Let's go ahead and book a table for Tuesday at 16:00. There will be 5 people.
