I am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should be in the cheap price range and should be in the north
Okay. There is a 0 star place, and a 4 star place. Which do you prefer?
I don't care as long as it's cheap.
I think the Worth House is your best bet!
alright. book that one for me
Are you booking for one person? When is your arrival and how long is your stay, please.
