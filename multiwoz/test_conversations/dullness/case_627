Hi, I am traveling to Cambridge and need help finding a train.
When would you like to travel and where are you coming from?
I would like to leave on Tuesday sometime after 13:00.
I have a train leaving London's Kings Cross station every 2 hours, starting at 13:17. The trip is 51 minutes long and costs 23.60 pounds.
I'll actually be departing from Leicester. What do you have available from there?
TR4032 will depart at 13:09 if that works for you?
Yes I need it booked for 4 people.
OK, the booking was successful. The total fee is 151.19 GBP, payable at the station. Your reference number is H02HFBMH .
I am also looking for a moderately priced chinese restaurant located in the north.
Golden wok is in the moderate price range and in the north area would you like me to book it for you?
Can I get the address and phone number please?
Of course - the address is 191 Histon Road Chesterton cb43hl and the phone number is 01223350688
