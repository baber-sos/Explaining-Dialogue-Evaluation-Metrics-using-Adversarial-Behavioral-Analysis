I am looking for places to go, do you have any attractions in the west part of town?
I have several museums and a few colleges to choose from. Which would you prefer?
I think I would prefer a museum.
The Museum of Classical Archaeology would be a fun place to check out, would you be interested?
Sure, give me their phone number. I'd also like to find an expensive restaurant in West Cambridge.
