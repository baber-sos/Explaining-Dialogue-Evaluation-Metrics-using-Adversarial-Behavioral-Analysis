Is there an expensive African restaurant in town.
Yes, The Bedouin in the city centre is a good, expensive restaurant.
Excellent! I don't need a table right now, but if you could give me the address and phone number, that would be great.
It is located at 100 Mill Road City Centre and the phone number is 01223367660. Is there anything else I can help you with?
