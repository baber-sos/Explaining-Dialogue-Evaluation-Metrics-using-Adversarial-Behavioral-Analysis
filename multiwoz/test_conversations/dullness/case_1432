Hi, I'm looking for restaurants in the area that serve British cuisine. Could you give me some suggestions?
There are many Indian restaurants in the city. Could you tell me in what area you would like to eat?
Is there something available in the west?
Yes, there are 3. Would you like something in the moderate or expensive price range?
I don't care about the price range. However, I need to confirm that the restaurant serves British food and is in the centre of town.
The Restaurant One Seven meets your specifications of british food in the centre of town. Would you like me to book that for you?
Yes. For 6 people at 19:30 on friday, please. I'll need the reference number.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : 59JRJR4E .
Great thanks so much!
Is there anything else I can help you with?
