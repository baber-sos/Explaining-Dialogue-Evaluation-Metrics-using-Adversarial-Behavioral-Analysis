Hi. I'm looking for a train to Norwich. Can you help please?
Sure, I'm finding 133 trains to norwich. I can narrow that down if you tell me where you're departing from.
I'm leaving from Cambridge on Sunday.
I have several results still. What time would you like to depart and arrive?
I would like to arrive by 19:00.
Certainly, we have a variety of departure times, the last train to arrive before 19:00 departs at 17:36 and arrives at 18:55. Would this interest you?
Yes, that sounds good. I will need 6 seats booked please.
I've booked 6 tickets for you, and your reference number is ZU6ERCQG .
Thanks, hate to bug you again but I need a 4 star place to stay that has free wifi and parking.
What area would you prefer?
I prefer a hotel in the center of town.
the alexander bed and breakfast is in the cheap range and the university arms hotel is in the expensive range. Which do you prefer?
Either is fine. Could you try to book one of those for 6 people for five nights, starting Tuesday?
Since you mentioned a hotel rather than a guesthouse, I've booked you at the University Arms Hotel, but just let me know if you prefer the other. Your reference# is P8GZALBU .
