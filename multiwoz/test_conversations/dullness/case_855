Hi, I'm looking for a hotel by the name of Acorn Guest House.
Sure, what would you like to know about it?
I would like to know if it is available for 8 people for 4 nights starting Saturday
Booking was successful. Reference number is : ZZPP7K9D . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Thank you. I now need help with a train from Cambridge to birmingham new street, please.
Absolutely. What day would you like, and when would you like to depart?
The train should leave after 12:30 and should leave on friday.
There are 11 entries here. Shall I book one of these trains?
Yes please, any of them will do. I just need the booking for 8 people.
I booked you on train TR2716 and your reference number is FNNVMU8Z .
Ok great, thanks for your help.
May I help with anything else ?
