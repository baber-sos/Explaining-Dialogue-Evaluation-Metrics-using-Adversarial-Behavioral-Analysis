Can you tell me about the Cambridge Belfry?
Sure thing! It's a cheap four star hotel on the west side with parking and internet available. Is there anything else you would like to know?
Can you get me the phone number? I like that they have free parking. That sounds great. Thanks!
01954714600 is their phone number.
Do they have free parking?
Yes, they have free parking, would you like me to book it?
Yes please. Also, i need a train that needs to get there around 20:30. Can you look that up as well?
Sure! which day would you like?
Monday, thank you. I'll be departing from leicester to cambridge.
The last train of the evening leaves at 18:09 and arrives at 19:54. Would you like me to book that for you?
