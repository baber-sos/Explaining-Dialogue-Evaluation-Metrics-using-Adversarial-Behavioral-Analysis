Can you get me information on a restaurant called mahal of cambridge?
Sure it is a cheap Indian restaurant in the town centre. I hear it has great food.
Do you think they would be able to make reservations for a party of 7?
I can help you with that. When would you like to make the reservation for?
17:45 for a table of 7 for the restaurant stated above. Thank you!
What day would you like that reservation for?
Oh, Tuesday please. And if you could give me a reference number, that'd be great.
I have successfully booked your table! Your reference number is WOQ10J3G . Anything else I can help you with today?
I would also like the address of a museum in the centre of town
Primavera is a museum in the center of town. Their address is 10 king s parade. What else can I help with?
Oh, I made a mistake. I really need that table for 16:15, not 17:45. Can you change it, do you thing?
Yes, I already changed it for you. Your new reference number is BTMSNGCD .
