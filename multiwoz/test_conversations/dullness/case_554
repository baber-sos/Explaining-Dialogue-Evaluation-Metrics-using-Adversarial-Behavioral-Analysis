I am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should have a star of 2 and should be in the moderate price range
There are two such hotels in the north area. The first is the ashley hotel and the second is the lovell lodge. Do you have a preference?
I don't have a preference, actually. Which one do you recommend?
They both have internet and parking, so it is really up to you.
I choose the ashley hotel. What is their address, please?
The number for the Ashley Hotel is 01223350059. Can I book that for you?

That question does not make sense to me.
