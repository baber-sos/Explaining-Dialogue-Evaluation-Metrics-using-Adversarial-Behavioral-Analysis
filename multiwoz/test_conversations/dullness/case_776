Yes I am looking for some hotels that include free parking and cheap rates in the Cambridge area.
There are 10 hotels, do you have any other preferences to narrow it down?
Sure. I'd like a guesthouse.
There are 9 options available. Do you have a preference for how many stars or what area specifically?
I don't care. Please book one that you recommend.
OK, how about the allenbell? To book a stay I'll need to know the first day you want to stay, how many days, and how many guests.
I need it for 8 people, and for 4 nights starting Saturday.
Great, I have booked your stay for 8 people for 4 nights. Your reference number is PB41WUOT . May I help with anything else?
I also would like to find a museum in the west.
