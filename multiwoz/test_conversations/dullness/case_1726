I would like to find some attractions in the west.
What type of attraction would you like to go to?
No specific preference, just need a recommendation
There are 5 colleges, an entertainment attraction and seven museums. They vary in admission price, how much would you like to pay?
I would like you to pick one and tell me the type, fee and the phone number please. Surprise me.
