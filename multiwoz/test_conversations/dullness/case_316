I am looking for a college in the east.
I apologize, I am unable to locate any colleges in the East. Would you like to try another area?
I'm sorry, I meant the centre.
I see. The centre offers 13 colleges. Most, like Saint Catharine's College on king's parade, are free to visit.
Can you give me the address, phone number, and entrance fee for Saint Catherine's College?
Sure the address is on King's Parade post code cb21rl. The phone number is 01223338300. Is there anything else that you need?
Yes I also need a train leaving from cambridge.
i have over a thousand trains leaving from cambridge. what day and time do you wish to travel?
I will travel on Sunday.
What is your destination and what time would you like to leave?
I would like to go to cambridge on sunday.
