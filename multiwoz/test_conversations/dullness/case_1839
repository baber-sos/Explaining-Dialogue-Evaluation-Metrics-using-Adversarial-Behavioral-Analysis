Hello, I am looking for a restaurant in Cambridge. I believe it is called Golden Wok.
It is located at 191 Histon Road Chesterton
Can you book me a table for 11:00 on Friday?
Yes I can! Table for 1?
Actually, for 4, please.
Okay, your booking was successful! The reference number is MUFCMYFF . The table will be reserved for 15 minutes.
Great, can you also get me information or architecture in the area
Sure. There are several churches and an old schools attraction, all in the centre area. Do you have a preference?
What do you recommend?
old schools is lovely, they are on trinity lane and free admission
Can I get the postcode for that? I also need to book a taxi to the Golden Wok.
The postcode is cb21tt. Are you looking for a taxi from Old Schools to the Golden Wok?
Yes I do. I'd like to make sure I arrive at the restaurant by the booked time. Can you check?
What time do you want to leave?
Actually all you have to do is set the taxi so it arrives by the arrived time. Am I better off booking it myself?
I have booked you a taxi for Friday to arrive at Old Schools at 10:45. Is there anything else I may help you with?
I need the contact number and car type also.
it is a Lexus white in colour and contact number is 07381884388
