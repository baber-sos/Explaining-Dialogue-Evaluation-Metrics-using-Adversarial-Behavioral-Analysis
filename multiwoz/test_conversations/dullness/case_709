I need help locating a place to go. Can you help?
Of course. What type of place?
I am looking for entertainment in the centre of town.
I hear the funky fun house is awesome.
Can I get the address. What is so funky about it?
It's a really fun house with lots of interesting things to do in it.
Interesting. Is it a museum?
Actually, for reasons that aren't clear to me, there are no entertainment attractions in the centre of Cambridge in our listings.
Okay. How about a museum instead?
I recommend the regency gallery, they have nice things. Would you like more information?
Yeah, I see them on the map but I need their entrance fee.
It is free admission for the Regency Gallery. Anything else for you today?
I need a train as well.
