I am trying to find out about trains that arrive in Cambridge
There are quite a few trains coming into Cambridge. Where will you be departing from?
I want to arrive by 16:15
Okay. First, let's find out you're departing from.
I will be departing from stevenage and going to cambridge.
There's a train running every day leaving at 13:54 and arriving at 14:43. Did you have a particular day in mind?
I am looking to travel on Monday.
The latest train arrives by 14:43 would you like me to book that for you?
That should work! I will also need a place to stay. I am looking for a guesthouse in the centre of town, in the expensive range. It should include free wifi as well.
I am terribly sorry no guesthouses are available, how about a hotel stay instead?
Sure, let's look at hotels instead, then.
I found two hotels do you want the detail information for the hotels?
Do either of them have free parking included?
Yes, they both offer free parking.
Could you provide the details?
The Gonville Hotel is on Gonville Place and is rated 3 stars. The University Arms Hotel is 4 stars and it's on Regent Street. Would you like to book a room?
Yes, this seems alright. Go ahead and book it.
Will you be needing the room for Monday?
No, actually, I'm not ready to book yet. That is all I need for today. Thanks. Bye.
