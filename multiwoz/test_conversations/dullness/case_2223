I am looking for a train going to Cambridge and leaving after 10:30.
I would be happy to help you find a train. Can you please tell me where you will be departing from?
I'll be departing from London Liverpool Street.
What day were you wanting to travel?
Monday departing from london liverpool st. Can you give the arrival time on that train please?
TR7040 leaves at 11:39. It arrives at 13:07. Would you like me to book that for you?
No thank you. I do need to find a place to stay as well. I need something moderately priced.
There are 18 moderately priced hotels and guest houses in cambridge. Do you have any more requirements to help narrow it down?
Yes, I would prefer a hotel and a rating of 0 stars.
Cityroomz is nice. Free internet too! May I book a room for you today?
