Can I get some help locating a room for the night?
Absolutely. What type of lodging did you have in mind?
I am looking for a guesthouse with free wifi and parking, please.
You're in luck, there are a great number of guesthouses that might work. Did you have an area in mind?
I don't care about the area. Which one do you suggest?
How about the Acorn Guest House?
That sounds great! I need a reservation just for me for 5 nights starting on Thursday.
I have that booked, the reference number is LULJ5N6X .
Thank you that is all , bye bye.
