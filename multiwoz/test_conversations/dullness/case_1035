What area do you want the restaurant to be in?
In the centre of town, if possible.

Yes, I would like the phone number. I also need a train on Monday to Cambridge from Birmingham New Street. I would like to leave after 13:15.
Here is the phone number 01223358899. Is there any particular time you would like to arrive by?
Any time will do, as long as it leaves after 13:15.
