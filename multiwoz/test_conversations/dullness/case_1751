I'd really like to get some Middle Eastern food. Can you find a cheap place for me to grab some dinner?
I see that there are none, maybe I should reconsider the cuisine. Thank you
Okay, thank you. goodbye
There is no middle east food in that area, another place or type perhaps?
Are there any that serve Italian food?

I don't know what you mean by that.
