Hi there. Can I get some help finding a hotel or guesthouse please?
Sure thing! What side of town would you prefer? What price range would you like?
I need one in the moderate price range. I would like one that doesn't have free parking.
There are 3 guesthouses and a hotel. Do you have a star rating that you enjoy staying at?
No not in particular.
I have four hotels. Do you know the area you would like to stay?
I'd prefer a guesthouse in the north, please.
I've got two options. The Alpha-Milton and the Avalon. Would you like me to book a room at either one?
Yes. The Apha-Milton sounds nice. Try that one, please.
I'd be happy to make your reservation for you. When would you like to arrive and how many are in your party?
