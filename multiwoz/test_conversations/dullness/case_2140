I'm trying to find an expensive restaurant in the centre part of town.
The Cambridge Chop House is an good expensive restaurant in the centre of town. Would you like me to book it for you?
Yes, a table for 1 at 16:15 on sunday. I need the reference number.
Great your reference number is NKLSHT8G
Could you help me find a train to Cambridge from Leicester please?
What day would you like me to book your train for?
