I need a train that leaves on Wednesday with an arrival of 12:30.
Where will you be travelling to and from?
I'm traveling from Cambridge to the London Liverpool Street.
The TR1047 leaves at 05:59 and arrives by 07:27. Is that alright?
Yes, that sounds fine. I need 7 tickets please.
Great. The reference number is 8BGCYRD5 and the total fee is 132.8 GBP. Can I help with anything else?
