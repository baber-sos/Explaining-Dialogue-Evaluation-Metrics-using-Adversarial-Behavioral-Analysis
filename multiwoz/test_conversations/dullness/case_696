Hello! I need to take a train on Monday, from Kings Lynn.
There area a number of departures on Monday starting at 5:11 in the morning. Was there a particular time of day you wanted to depart?
Any time after 13:15 would be fine.
TR2257 leaves at 14:11. Would you like to purchase a ticket?
I just need the arrival time and price at this moment.
Train TR2257 arrives by 14:58 and cost is 9.80 pounds.
I also need an attraction that has a boat.
I can help with that. What area would you like me to check out for you?
Any area with a boat is fine.
I have four. What would you like to know about them?
You choose. Can I get the phone number, postcode, and address?
I'd recommend Camboats, the number is 01223902112 and address is the plough, green end, fen ditton, cb58sx
