Well, I am planning a trip and could use some help with a place to stay.
I have 33 choices. Is there a particular area you would like to stay in?
I don't have a particular area. It does need to be moderately priced.
Do you have a parking or internet preference?
Yes, I'd like free parking and free wifi. Thanks!
