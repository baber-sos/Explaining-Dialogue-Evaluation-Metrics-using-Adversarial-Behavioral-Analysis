I am looking for a 3 star hotel in Cambridge with free wifi
There are five hotels that meet that criteria. Do you have a location or price range in mind?
I would like something cheap.
Unfortunately, none of the cheap hotels have free wifi. Would you prefer to try a different price range or go with a hotel without free wifi?
How about a hotel with a 4 star rating?
There are many what area would you like to stay in?
Kindly recommend one of the many in the area and send me the address.
the Cambridge belfry is located at back lane, cambourne. Postcode cb236bw.
I also need a place to eat that serves italian food and should be in the same price range as the hotel.
In what area of town do you prefer it to be?
The area does not matter.
I would recommend la margherita, located at 15 Magdalene Street City Centre on the west side of town. Phone number is 01223315232. Do you need to make a reservation?
Yes, I would like to book a table for 3 on Friday at 11:30.
Done! Your reference number is LULDC1BO . Do you need help with anything else?
I want to book a taxi from the hotel to the restaurant, that arrives at 11:30.
