Can you help me find an expensive hotel in the south to stay at? Thanks.
Yes, there is The Lensfield Hotel. It is located on 53-57 Lensfield road. Their phone number is 01223355017.
Do they have a guesthouse available?
No I am afraid there ae no expensive guesthouses in the south.
How about one in the moderate price range?
yes! i have two you may choose from!
Could you pick the better of the two and tell me the star rating?
The Ayesbray Lodge Guesthouse has a four star rating. Would you like me to book a room?
No, just get me their phone number and I'll give them a ring
