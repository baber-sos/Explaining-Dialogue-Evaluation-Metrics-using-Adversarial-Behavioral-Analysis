There are no restaurants that serve Danish food. Is there another food type you might be interested in?
How about an Indian restaurant?

How about an expensive one?
We have 14 expensive Indian restaurants. Do you have an area you prefer?
Which one do you recommend?
I'd recommend Tandoori Palace in the west, would you like to make a reservation?
Yes, please. Can you reserve me a table for Tuesday for 1 person at 15:45?
