I want to find a moderately priced place to stay that has at least a 3-star rating
which side of town do you prefer?
Any area is okay as long as the hotel includes free parking. I don't need internet.
Bridge guest house has all that you need, would you like to book that?
yes please book it for 1
What day would you like ?
3 days and get me phone number, postcode, and address please
I will need the day you plan on arriving.
Actually I am don't need to book a room just yet but can you provide the phone number, postcode, and address.
All right, sure. The postal code is cb28rj and the address is 151 Hills Road. Their phone number is 01223247942. Anything else?
I am also looking for a Molecular gastronomy place to eat, moderate price.
I'm very sorry there are no results for a molecular gastronomy restaurant. Would you like to try for another type of cuisine?
Oh, that's too bad. How about international food?
