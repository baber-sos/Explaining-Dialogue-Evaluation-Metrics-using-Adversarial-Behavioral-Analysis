I need to find a place to stay that includes free parking and is moderately priced.
I have many guesthouses and hotels available. Do you have a preference on the number of stars or location?
No star preference, but I would like it to be a hotel type.
There are two hotels that fit your criteria: the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge. Which would you prefer?
The Ashley Hotel will do fine. Can you book me a room there? It will just be myself staying.
How many days would you be staying there?
id be staying for 3 nights
Perfect, and what day will you be arriving?
I'll be arriving on Monday.
Booking was successful. Reference number is : TY5A2H5O . Is there anything else I can help with?
Yes, I'm interested in knowing what attractions are in the area as well.
In the north we have riverboat georgina, milton country park, jesus green outdoor pool, and kings hedges learner pool. Do any of these sound good?
I am interested in visiting one of the colleges actually.
Unfortunately there are no colleges located in the north area of the city. Would you like to try another area of town?
Yes please. Any area would be fine so long as its a nice college to visit. Would you recommend the best one?
