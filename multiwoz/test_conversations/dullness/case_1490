Hi, I'm looking for an expensive restaurant that serves Moroccan food in Cambridge please.
I'm sorry, there are no expensive Moroccan restaurants in Cambridge.
Ok, how about Chinese food then?
There are several. If you don't have a preference as to where in town you eat, might I suggest the good luck chinese food takeaway?
Is it in the expensive range?
Yes it is. Would you like me to send you their address?
Can you book me a table for one on Friday at 13:45? I will need the reference number as well.
