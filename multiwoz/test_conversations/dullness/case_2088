I need a train to Cambridge and I need it to leave after 12:45.
There are 833 trains that meet your needs. Would you like to narrow it down by departure station and/or day of travel?
I'm leaving from peterborough and need to travel on tuesday.
That narrows it down to 23 choices. What time were you wishing to arrive?
Arrival time doesn't matter, it just needs to depart after 12:45. I'll need to book the travel for 8 people. Are there any that can accommodate that many?
The TR4679 departs at 13:19. Booking was successful for 8 people, the total fee is 132 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : GVI45XUY .
