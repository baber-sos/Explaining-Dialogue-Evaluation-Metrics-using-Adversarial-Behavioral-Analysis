Hi, I am traveling to Cambridge and need help finding a train.
When would you like to travel and where are you coming from?
I would like to leave on Tuesday sometime after 13:00.
I have a train leaving London's Kings Cross station every 2 hours, starting at 13:17. The trip is 51 minutes long and costs 23.60 pounds.
I'll actually be departing from Leicester. What do you have available from there?
TR4032 will depart at 13:09 if that works for you?

That question does not make sense to me.
