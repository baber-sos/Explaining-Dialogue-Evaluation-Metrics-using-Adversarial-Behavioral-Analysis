I need more on a hotel called a and b guest house.
Yes, they are a 4 star rated hotel in the east aide, pricing is moderate.
Do they have free parking?
no parking but you can park your vehicle nearby
I would also like to find a restaurant.
Would you like the restaurant in the East as well? Were you looking for any price range of style of cuisine?
I would like a restaurant in the centre, preferably a steakhouse in the cheap price range.
We don't have a match for you. In general, you'll be hard pressed to find a cheap steakhouse anywhere.
