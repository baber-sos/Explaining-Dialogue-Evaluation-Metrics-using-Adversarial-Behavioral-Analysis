I heard you have good cheap restaurants. While I am there, I would like to try one?
There are a total of 22 cheap restaurants located in town. Is there a specific area you are going to be in?
Can you check in the centre of town?
There are several options available to you, is there a specific type of food you are wanting to try?
Anything will work, book me for what available, Ill need the postal code for wherever I am booked.
The Golden House has a postal code of cb21eg. Will this work for you? I can book it if you please.
That's all I needed on restaruants. Can you help me find a place to stay in the same area with a 4 star rating?
