I need more on a hotel called a and b guest house.
Yes, they are a 4 star rated hotel in the east aide, pricing is moderate.
Do they have free parking?
no parking but you can park your vehicle nearby
I would also like to find a restaurant.
Would you like the restaurant in the East as well? Were you looking for any price range of style of cuisine?
I would like a restaurant in the centre, preferably a steakhouse in the cheap price range.
We don't have a match for you. In general, you'll be hard pressed to find a cheap steakhouse anywhere.
How about one that serves Spanish food?
La raza is a cheap Spanish restaurant in the center of town. Do you want me to book it for you?
Sure! I need a table for 3 at 17:45 on Tuesday.
Great! Your reference number is 95RPVN70 . Anything else I can do for you?
No, thank you. I am all set with your help. Goodbye.
