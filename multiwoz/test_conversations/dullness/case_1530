Hi! What can you tell me about 4-star guesthouses in town?
There are 18 matching your request. Do you have any preferences such as area, price, parking, or internet?
Yes, I would like a guesthouse in the south part of town and it should include wifi.
There are 2: Rosa's Bed and Breakfast is cheap, located at 53 roseford road cb22ha and Aylesbray Lodge Guest House is moderate, located at 5 mowbray road cb17sr. Shall we book?
Yes, let's try Rosa's for 3 nights starting Friday. There will be 8 of us.
You are all set for checking in on Friday. Your reference number is 32GMTM5V . Can I help with anything else?
