Where is the train that arrives at 11:00 and leaves to Cambridge?
What day do you wish to travel and where are you departing from?
I want to depart from Broxbourne on Friday.
TR2145 arrives in Cambridge by 10:32. Would that work for you?
Yes. Please book for 6 people.
Okay, tickets fro 6 have been booked! Your reference number is AUQ1WQY3 . Can I help you with anything else?
Thank you. Now I would like to party all night at a good night club. Can you help with that?
Yes, I can help you find a nightclub.
I would like one in the west.
I'm so sorry, I'm not showing any nightclubs in the west. Could I look in a different part of town for you?
Okay are there any good colleges in that area?
Queens college would fit that criteria. can I get you more info on it?
What's the entrance fee?
The entrance fee is 2.50 pounds. Did you need any more information?
Yes, I also need the address and postcode please.
