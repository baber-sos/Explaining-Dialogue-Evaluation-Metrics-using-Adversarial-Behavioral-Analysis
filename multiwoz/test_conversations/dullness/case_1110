I am looking for information in Cambridge
I'm happy to help you with that. Is there something in specific I can tell you about?
I'm staying in the west and I want to find a place near here that serves real British food.
Saint johns chop house is in the moderate price range serving British food.
Cool, could you give me the phone number?
Yes, they can be reached at 01223353110, is there anything else that I can help with?
I also need a train for Thursday.
