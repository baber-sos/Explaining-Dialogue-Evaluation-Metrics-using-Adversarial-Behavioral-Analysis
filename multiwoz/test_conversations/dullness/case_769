My friend told me about a place called the Carolina Bed and Breakfast. Do you know anything about it?
It's a 4 star guesthouse. What information would you like to know about it?
Can you give me the postcode? And, do they have internet?
The postcode is cb13nx, and they do have internet.
Thank you. Are there any boat attractions in the west?
Nothing in the west, sorry. The closest boat would be the Cambridge Punter in the centre. Is that too far?
Yes, it is. How about a musuem?
There are 5 museums in the West. I recommend Kettle's Yard. Would you like the address and phone?
Yes, I would love the address. Thank you so much!
Kettle's yard is on castle street, cb30aq. Can I help you with anything else?
Great. That is all I need.
