I'm so bored! Can you find me something to do in the centre of town?
If you are into contemporary art, Cambridge Contemporary Art is a great place to relieve boredom. The address is 6 Trinity Street. Best of all, there isn't any entrance fee.
Thank you that sounds great.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes, actually. Can I ask for help finding a train for Monday going to Cambridge?
Where would you be departing from?

That question does not make sense to me.
