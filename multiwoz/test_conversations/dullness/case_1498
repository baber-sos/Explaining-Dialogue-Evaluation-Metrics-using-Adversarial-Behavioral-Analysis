Hello, I am looking for a restaurant that is in the town centre that serves Chinese food.
There are many restaurants that fit your specifications. Do you have a price range in mind?
The moderate price range would be best.
I found three moderate chinese restaurants. Would you like to book at jinling noodle bar?
Yes please. Please provide the phone number before you book.
The phone number is 01223566188. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Yes, I'm also looking for a train departing after 8:45 to Bishops Stortford.
I can help you with that, where will you be departing from?
From Cambridge on Saturday.
The closest, unfortunately, is the TR3396 that departs at 09:29, which does leave a 44 minute wait for you. Do you still want me to book this for you?
Could you give me the price for this train, please?
The price is 8.08 GBP per ticket. Is there anything else I can help with today?
I think that should be it thank you
How many people are you booking for?
I am booking for one person.
Your booking was successful, reference number is N2J38YE1 .
Thanks, that's all for today.
Thank you for using our service. Goodbye!
