Hi! I'm planning a trip in Cambridge and I'm looking for a restaurant in the west part of town.
There are fourteen restaurants in the west. Is there any kind of food you're looking for?
how about you suggest one a book a table for 4 on tuesday at 15:45 and I need the reference number too please
I was able to book saint johns chop house, reference number is G579W1K0
Can you please book a train to Cambridge that arrives by 11:30?
There are many! What is your departure station, and what day are you traveling?
The same day as the booking, and I'm coming from birmingham new street.
TR0254 would leave at 05:40 and arrive by 08:23. Is this too early for you?
Is there a train that arrives closer to 11:30? If so I just need the id, price, and travel time.
