Hi, can you help me find a Caribbean restaurant to eat at on my upcoming visit?
Oh no! We don't have any Caribbean restaurants at the moment. Is there another type you'd like?
Can you please look for an Italian food restaurant?
We have quite a few Italian restaurants. Is there a particular part of the city in which you would like to dine?
I'm looking for a italian place in the moderate price range. Can you suggest one and make reservations please?
May I recommend Prezzo, it is located in the west and has a moderate price range. Is there a specific date, time and number of people?
Yes, that sounds great, thank you. I want to book a table for 4 people at 15:15 on Wednesday. I'll also need a reference number.
You have been booked at the Prezzo for Wednedsday at 15:15 for 4 people. Your reference number is KCV0WNR3 . Your table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Anything else?
I also need a train going to cambridge and departing from birmingham new street.
What day will you need the train? I have to narrow it down so I can better serve you.

That is very interesting.
