Hello I'll be coming to Cambridge and need a room to stay in. Can you recommend a guesthouse that has free parking?
I have 21 guesthouses in cambridge. What price range and what area were you looking for?
I don't have a price range in mind. But I would like a 4 star rating and somewhere that offers free parking.
Ok, there are 16 hotels that meet that criteria. Is there a particular area of town you're interested in?
No I don't care which area it is in, just so it is a guesthouse with free parking and 4 stars.
The Alexander Bed and Breakfast is a popular choice. It's inexpensive, but rated 4 stars, and offers both free parking and free wifi.
Can you book it for me?
which day would you like to book and for how long?
I need to book it on friday for 2 nights for 8 people. Could i please have the reference number?
Booking was successful, your reference number is : XV3JOKGD . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Yes, please. I need to go to Birmingham New Street on Saturday, and I'd like to get there at or shortly before 18:15.
I think TR3735 would be acceptable. It leaves Saturday at 15:01 and arrives in Birmingham New Street at 17:44. It's 163 minutes of travel time. Should I book it?
That should work, yes please get me 8 tickets.
Okay the booking was successful and total cost is 480.64 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : GSCM7CWQ . Anything else I can help you with?
No, that's all I need today. Thanks for the help!
