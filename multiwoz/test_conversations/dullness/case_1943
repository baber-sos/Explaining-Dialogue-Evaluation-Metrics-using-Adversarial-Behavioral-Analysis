I need a train that leaves on Monday going to Cambridge.
Wonderful, I can help you. Could you tell me where you're departing from so we can begin to book your ticket?
Yes, I'll be departing from London Kings Cross. I'd also like to arrive in Cambridge by 10:30.
Train TR0378 would leave at 05:17 and arrive at at 06:08. Would you like me to book that for you?
The booking is for 8 people. If the train can accommodate that number of people please book the train and provide a reference number.
It was successful. Your reference number is XFS7GQHZ
Thanks! I'm also looking for the Curry Prince restaurant, do you know where that is?
Yes, it is located at 451 Newmarket Road in Fen Ditton. Can I book a table for you?
What area is that in?
The east part of town
Yes, I would like a reservation.
Okay, for how many people?
I need it for 8 people.
And what day and time would you like the reservation for?
Actually, I won't be able to stay in town for dinner this time. Thanks for everything you've helped me with. Bye.
