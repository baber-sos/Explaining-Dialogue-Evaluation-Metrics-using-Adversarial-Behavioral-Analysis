Hi, I'm looking for a hotel called aylesbray lodge guest house. Do you have anything with that name?
We do have a hotel with that name. It is in the south area and is moderately priced. Would you like me to book this for you?
Can you confirm if this is a guesthouse or hotel? Do they have free wifi?
the aylesbray is a guest house and yes, it does include free internet. Would you like me to book for you?
No that won't be necessary. What is the address though so I have it for my reference?
The address in 5 Mowbray Road. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
