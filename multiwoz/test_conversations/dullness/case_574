Yes, hello. I'd like to book a taxi to what I believe is a restaurant.
Sure, I can do that. Do you know the name of the restaurant? Also, when would you like to be picked up and arrive by?
Yes, Oak Bistro and will depart from Sheep's Green and Lammas land park fen causeway.
Ok great, I will also need to know what your preferences are for your pick up and arrival times to book your taxi.
