Find me a restaurant in the centre that serves corsica food
I'm sorry, we don't have anything matching that. Is there something else I can help with?
how about just something that's really overpriced? i don't care if the food is good, just want to impress my boss
There are 33 restaurants fitting your parameters. What kind of cuisine would you like?
What about mediterranean food?
We have two: La Mimosa, and Shiraz Restaurant.
Let's book it for La Mimosa for 3 people at 17:30 on Thursday.
Okay, your booking was successful. Your reference number is P886DG7V . Your table will be reserved for 15 minutes.
Great. Thank you so much. I also need information on a train to London Liverpool street.
