There are hotels with free wifi and parking, right?
Yes there are plenty. What area would you like to stay in?
The hotel should be in the centre and should be in the type of guesthouse.
There are two hotels that fit that criteria. I would recommend Alexander Bed and Breakfast, it has four stars.
book it for 1 people and 4 nights starting from tuesday.
I'm sorry, your booking was unsuccessful. Would you like to book another day or a shorter stay?
How about Wednesday?
