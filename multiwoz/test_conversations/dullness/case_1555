Are there any places in the east of town that are recommended to go to? Thanks.
Yes, several. The Cambridge Museum of Technology is good, or if you're in a more aquatic frame of mind there's the Abbey Pool and Astroturf Pitch. Do they sound appealing?
I need the postcode please.
The postcode for the museum is cb58ld.
Can you book tickets for me?
I'm sorry, our service can't book museums but their phone is 01223368650.
