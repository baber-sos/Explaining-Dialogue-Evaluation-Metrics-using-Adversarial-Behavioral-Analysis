I'm excited to be traveling to cambridge and would like to find some places to go in the centre of town.
Luckily, there are 44 places to go in the town centre. Do you have a certain type of place you would like to go?
Yes, I would like a theatre in the centre.
The mumford theatre is in town centre, located at anglia ruskin enterprise, east road. Would you like their phone number?
Yes I would like their phone number.
Okay, their phone number is 08451962320.
I'm also looking for the Carolina Bed and Breakfast. What area is it in?
The carolina is in the east part of town. Would you like me to book a room for you?
No, that's okay, I just needed to know what area it was in.
Just in case you need it the phone number is 01223247015. Was there anything else I can assist you with today?
No, thanks - I'm all set. You've been a great help.
