I need to take a train from cambridge, I need to arrive at my destination by 17:00/
Okay, what day did you have in mind?
I would like to leave on Saturday.
What station would you like to arrive at?
I need to get to Norwich please.
TR3823 will arrive at 16:55, would that work for you?
That cuts it a little close but it will do. I don't need it booked, though. Can you also find me a place to get some food?
I sure can! Do you have a specific area and type of food you are looking for?
I would like an indian restaurant in the centre, please.
I have many. is there a price range that you prefer?
Whichever ever one has 11:00 for two people on the same day available, that one would be fine.
I was able to book a table for 2 at Curry Garden on Saturday at 11:00. The reference number is 0ZBV3E4C . Is there anything else we can help you with?
