I need to find a restaurant that serves Weish food in the centre of town please.
I'm sorry, but there are no restaurants that match your criteria. Would you like to broaden your search?
Yes, are there any Weish restaurants in the cheap price range that are in north Cambridge?
I'm sorry, but there are no welsh restaurants in all of cambridge.
Can you change my food preference to Chinese then? I still want to be in the cheap range and center of town.
I found 3 options for you: Charlie Chan at Regent Street City Centre, Rice House at 88 Mill Road City Centre, and Golden House at 12 Lensfield Road City Centre
Please book a table for 4 at Charlie Chan.
I cannot book a reservation for you until I know what time and day your planning on going there.
I apologize. I would like a table for 4 at 16:45 on Wednesday. Please tell me my reference number, if you don't mind.
I have confirmed your reservation at Charlie Chan's on Wednesday at 16:45 for four. The reference number is YHXA6WCS . Is there anything else you need help with?
Yes, I'm also looking for a train to Cambridge arriving by 11:30.
There are 420 trains that meet those criteria. Where are you departing from and on what day?
It should be on Wednesday as well, and depart from the stansted airport
There are 6 trains that will arrive prior to 11:30. Do you prefer a particular arrival time?
Yes I need to arrive by 11:30 as I stated earlier.
I found one that arrives by 9:52 it is TR3828, would you like to book that?
Sure that sounds good, I will need 4 tickets please, and the reference number.
Booking was successful, the total fee is 40.4 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : 67WHT21L .
Perfect, thank you!
You're welcome. Can I help you with anything else?
No, thank you. That's all I need today.
Thank you for using our service. Have a wonderful day!
