I'm looking for a train to cambridge.
What day will you be traveling?
I would like to leave on Friday.
Okay I have several. What time are you leaving, and how many tickets would you like?
I am leaving Thurtsday at 2pm and need three tickets
I have the TR5502 that leaves at 3:17pm. Would that work for you?
Actually, I never told you where I was leaving from. I need the train to depart from Kings Lynn.
TR2162 leaves at 14:11. Want to book it?
yes please, 7 people. And I'd like the reference number please.
