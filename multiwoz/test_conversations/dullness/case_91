Please find me a place to dine that serves vegetarian food that's in the expensive price range.
Oh dear. I did a search for a cheap vegetarian restaurant and my computer doesn't list one. Would you like me to check the moderate range?
I am actually wanting the restaurant to be expensive and in the centre of town.
I am sorry but there are no restaurants matching that criteria. Would you like to try another price range or part of town?
Are there any expensive french restaurants in the centre?
Yes, one of my favorites. Cote on Bridge Street City Centre.
Can you book a table for 5 at 17:00 on friday.
I booked a table for your party of 5 at Cote for Friday at 17:00. Your reference is B3LAV5Z1 and the table will be reserved for 15 minutes
Can you help me with places to go? I like architecture.
There are four churches and a place called old schools for architecture. They are all conveniently located in the center of town.
Can you get me the phone number for old schools please?
Yes, the phone number is 01223332320.
Thank you for all your help today. Goodbye.
You're welcome! Have a wonderful day!
