Hello, I would like to book a train, leaving Cambridge and going to Stansted Airport.
Ok, when would you like to leave and what time would you like to leave at?
I just want to arrive in stansted airport on tuesday before 11:00.
TR1951 leaves Cambridge at 06:40 and arrives at the airport at 07:08. Would that work?
