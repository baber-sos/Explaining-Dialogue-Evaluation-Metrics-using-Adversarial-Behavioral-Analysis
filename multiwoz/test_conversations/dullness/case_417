I'm looking to book lodging for a place to stay, it should be a guesthouse and have free wifi.
In what area would you prefer it to be?
I would like one in Caimbridge that is in the cheap price range.
I have 9 of them. If you don't have a certain area, I can recommend the el shaddai.
The El Shaddi is fine. Can I please have a room for 4 people, for 4 nights, starting from Monday?
Your rooms at the El Shaddai have been booked. Your reference number is JYUN4Q2R . Is there anything further I can assist you with today?
Yes, please help me find a train? I need to travel on Friday, and I need to arrive at my destination by 21:15, please.
What are your departure and destination cities?
