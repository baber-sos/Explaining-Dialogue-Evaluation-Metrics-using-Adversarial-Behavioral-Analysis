I'm looking to book lodging for a place to stay, it should be a guesthouse and have free wifi.
In what area would you prefer it to be?
I would like one in Caimbridge that is in the cheap price range.
I have 9 of them. If you don't have a certain area, I can recommend the el shaddai.
The El Shaddi is fine. Can I please have a room for 4 people, for 4 nights, starting from Monday?
Your rooms at the El Shaddai have been booked. Your reference number is JYUN4Q2R . Is there anything further I can assist you with today?
Yes, please help me find a train? I need to travel on Friday, and I need to arrive at my destination by 21:15, please.
What are your departure and destination cities?
I am leaving from Cambridge and going to Stansted Airport.
I have 16 trains to choose from. Do you have a price preference?
No, but if you can't decide, maybe pick the one that departs the latest and still gets us their by 21:15.
Ok the TR9595 leaves at 20:40, do you want a booking?
Yes, please book that train for 4 people.
Booking was successful, the total fee is 40.4 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : M9UXW8S8 .
Wonderful. Thank you for your help today.
My pleasure. Enjoy your stay.
