I want a restaurant in the city centre that serves Italian food.
There are nine listings available. What price range were you interested in?
I am interested in a restaurant that is in the expensive price range.
Clowns Cafe is a restaurant in the city centre with that price range. Would you like to make a reservation?
Sure! How close is the Cafe from my current location?
The Clowns Cafe is in the centre area. Would you like me to book you a reservation?
Yes, please. I'd like a table for 6 at 18:45 on Friday.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : F29AMXP7 .
I also need to HOTEL to stay at in the centre.
There are 3 hotels in that area. Would you prefer a moderately priced or expensive hotel?
No price range, it doesn't have to have internet though.
cityroomz is moderate with 0 stars, gonville hotel has 3 stars and is expensive, university arms is also expensive and has 4 stars? Will any of these do?
Are they all hotels or guesthouses?
They are all hotels. Is this acceptable?
Sure can I get one with free wifi please?
They all have free wifi. Is there a star rating you prefer?
No just book me rooms for six people for two nights.
Non of the hotels were available for 2 nights starting on Friday. Would you prefer another date or area.
Can you book me a room for 1 night instead?
Your booking at cityroomz was successful, reference number is SEIH4HYO
Thank you. I would also like a taxi to commute between the hotel and restaurant.
Would you be departing from the restaurant or the hotel? And when would you like to leave?
I will be departing from the hotel and going to the restaurant. I need to be there in time for my reservation.
Wonderful, your taxi is booked. It will be a yellow ford and the contact number is 07822741112. Is there anything else I can help you with?
That's it thanks!
