I am looking for a train departing from Cambridge that will arrive at bishops stortford.
There are many trains that leave Cambridge and arrive in Bishops Stortford, what day and time would you like to leave?
I would like to leave on Thursday and arrive no later than 18:00.
I have found six trains leaving on Thursday with the latest leaving at 15:29 and arriving by 16:07. Would you like to book this?
That sounds like a good one. Can I please have the reference number?
Train TR7759 is leaving on Thursday at 15:29 to arrive by 16:07.
could you book 3 tickets for me and send me the reference number?
You got it, your reference number is 2XQU7JJS . Thanks.
