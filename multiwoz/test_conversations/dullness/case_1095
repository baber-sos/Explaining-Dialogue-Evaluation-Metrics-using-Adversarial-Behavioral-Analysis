Hello, I am looking for a restaurant that is in the town centre that serves Chinese food.
There are many restaurants that fit your specifications. Do you have a price range in mind?
The moderate price range would be best.
I found three moderate chinese restaurants. Would you like to book at jinling noodle bar?
Yes please. Please provide the phone number before you book.
The phone number is 01223566188. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
