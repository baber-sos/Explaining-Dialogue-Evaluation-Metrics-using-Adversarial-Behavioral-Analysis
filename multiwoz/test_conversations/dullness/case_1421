I am looking for a place to stay in the north of the city. I would prefer a 4 star hotel please.
There are several guesthouses available. Do you have a price reference?
No price preference needed
The home from home guesthouse hotel is located in the north, has a 4 star rating, and is moderately priced. Would you like me to book it for you?
Does it have free wifi?
How about the Avalon guesthouse?
I think that would be fine.
What day would you like to stay? How many days?
I would like it book for Sunday for 5 people and 3 nights. Can I have the booking number please.

That question does not make sense to me.
