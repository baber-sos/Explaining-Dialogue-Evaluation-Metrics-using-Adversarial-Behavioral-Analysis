I need to get to London Kings Cross. Can you help me find a train?
I have 70 trains matching your request. Is there a specific day and time when you would like to travel?
The train should arrive by 15:45 and should leave on Friday from Cambridge.
There are 5 trains. Would you like to leave at 5:00?
Sure, that would work. How much would that cost, and how long would the travel time be?
