I am planning a trip in Cambridge.
What part of your trip may I be of assistance with?
I am looking for a hotel that includes free wifi.
I have several options available. Do you prefer a cheap, moderate or expensive price range?
I prefer the hotel has at least a two star rating.
The Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge in the north are both moderately priced, two star hotels. There is also a more expensive option in the east. All have internet.
Which of those have free parking?
Both the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge have free parking.

That question does not make sense to me.
