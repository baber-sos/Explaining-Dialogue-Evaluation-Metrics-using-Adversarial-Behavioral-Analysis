I am looking for a Chinese restaurant an expensive one.
There are a number of restaurants that fit what you are looking for. What area would you like and how many people?
The area doesn't matter. Anywhere where I can get a table for 5 at 15:30 on Saturday.
Ok, I've booked at Yu Garden for 5 at 15:30 on Saturday. Your reference number is JDFXWUMM .
Great! Can you also help me with a place to go in town. I would like it to be in the centre.
There is the all saints church that is an architecture destination in the centre of town, would you like that?
That sounds nice. What is the postcode for that location, and is there a fee?
