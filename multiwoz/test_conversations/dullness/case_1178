I am looking for a train from Cambridge to Birmingham New Street.
The next train leaving from Cambridge for Birmingham New Street departs Friday at 5:01, and will arrive by 7:44.
I need a train that departs after 08:30 on Friday.
I have a train leaving Cambridge arriving at Birmingham New Street on Friday at 9:01. Would you like me to book this for you?
Yes please, that sounds perfect.
And how many tickets will you need for your trip?
Actually, I don't need booking. Please just give me the train's travel time and price.
