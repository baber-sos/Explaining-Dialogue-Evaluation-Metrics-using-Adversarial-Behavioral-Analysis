Hi, I am trying to plan my trip and could use some help with a particular restaurant.
Do you have any restaurant name in mind, Choice of food and location, price range so we narrow down our search for you?
It's called Cambridge Lodge Restaurant.
Would you like me to book you a reservation?
Yes I would like reservations for 2 people at 13:45 on monday.
I made the reservation, and here is your reference number: 8KULT1F8 . Thank you for calling our help desk!
I am also looking for places to visit on the north side of town.
The attractions in that area are boat, a park, and swimming pool. Would you like more information on any of these?
Would you just recommend one and let me know what type it is please?
I would recommend Milton Country Park. Would you like the information?
Just tell me the attraction type please
