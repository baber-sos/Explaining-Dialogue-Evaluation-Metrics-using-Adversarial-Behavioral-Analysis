I need a train to Norwich, from Cambridge.
What day were you planning to travel?
On Tuesday. I need to get into Norwich by 15:00.
TR1659 is train that goes from cambridge to norwich and arrives at norwich at 14:55. Would you like to book it?
No thanks. I don't want to book today. But can you tell me what time that train departs?
TR1659 leaves Cambridge at 13:36.
Thank you, I also need to find a place to stay. I would prefer a guesthouse.
I have 24 guesthouses available. Did you have a price range in mind?
Yes the cheap price range
There are 9 guesthouses in the cheap price range. Is there an area or a star rating you prefer?
Yes, I prefer one located to the west. I don't care of how many stars it has.
Finches bed and breakfast is the only place that matches your criteria.
Okay, then book a room for 4 people and 5 nights on Thursday.
Good news. Your booking was successful. Your reference number is GZH5Q65C . Is there anything else I can help you with?
No, that was everything I needed help with, thank you.
