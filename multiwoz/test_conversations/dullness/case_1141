I want to visit some architecture.
If you come to the centre of town there are several magnificent churches. And the Old Schools are quite impressive as well. Would you like more information about any of them?
Is there a phone number I can get for the schools please
The phone number for Old Schools is 01223332320
Thank you! I also need to find a place to eat while there. Something expensive.
