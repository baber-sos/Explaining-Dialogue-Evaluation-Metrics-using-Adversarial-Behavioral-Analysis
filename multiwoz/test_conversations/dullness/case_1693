Hi. I'm looking for a train to Norwich. Can you help please?
Sure, I'm finding 133 trains to norwich. I can narrow that down if you tell me where you're departing from.
I'm leaving from Cambridge on Sunday.
I have several results still. What time would you like to depart and arrive?
I would like to arrive by 19:00.
Certainly, we have a variety of departure times, the last train to arrive before 19:00 departs at 17:36 and arrives at 18:55. Would this interest you?
Yes, that sounds good. I will need 6 seats booked please.
I've booked 6 tickets for you, and your reference number is ZU6ERCQG .
Thanks, hate to bug you again but I need a 4 star place to stay that has free wifi and parking.
What area would you prefer?
I prefer a hotel in the center of town.
