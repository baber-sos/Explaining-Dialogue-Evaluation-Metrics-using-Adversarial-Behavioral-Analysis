I am planning a visit to Cambridge very soon and need some information about types of lodging available.
There are 33 places to stay at. Would you like a cheap one?
No, I want an expensive hotel with free wi-fi.
How about the express by holiday inn cambridge, it's in the east.
Does it have free parking?
Yes it does. Would you like to go ahead and make a reservation?
No thanks, but could you provide me with their postcode?
Certainly. The postcode is cb13lh.
