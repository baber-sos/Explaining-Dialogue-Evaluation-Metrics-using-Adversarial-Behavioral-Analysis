I'd like to find a place to go. Something in the south.
There are 8 attractions in the south. Would you like to visit a nightclub?
Yes, what nightclub would you recommend? Can you tell me the address, including the postcode, and the entrance fee?
The Place is at 22 sidney street. The postcode is cb23hg. We do not have information on the entrance fee.
Are you sure that you cannot find the entrance fee for me? And I am also looking for Bridge Guest House.
