Hi, can you give me some information on a place to stay when I arrive in Cambridge next week?
There are 24 guesthouses and 9 hotels across Cambridge. What type of place and price range are you looking for?
Not worried about the price but I would like a guesthouse in the east with free wifi.
The a and b guest house is in the east with free wifi. Would you like their address?
Yes, and may you please book a room in the hotel for 4 nights? It's for one person.
I can help you with that. What day will you be arriving at the hotel?
I will be arriving on Monday, I will need the reference number please.
The address for the A and B Guest House is 124 Tenison Road. Your reservation has been set for check-in on Monday and your reference number is 1GWCWHLM .
I'm also looking for some places to go in the same area as the hotel. Can you make some suggestions? I need the address, postcode, and entrance fee if any.
What type of attraction are you looking for?
How about some restaurants, and I want to book a taxi so that I can travel from place to place.
I apologize. I don't want to misunderstand your request. So, you are wanting to look for an attraction or a restaurant?
Sorry, I'm looking for an attraction.
The Cambridge artworks museum is located at 5 greens road cb13ef. It has free admission.
do they have ample parking?
I'm sorry I don't have that information.
That's fine, uh... I want to book a taxi so that I can travel from the guest house to the museum.
What day and time would you like to book a taxi for?
I would like to leave the museum by 23:15 to head back to the guesthouse.
Okay, your driver will be in a red BMW and the contact number is 07055562592. Can I just confirm, you're traveling back to the guesthouse from the museum?
Great thank you. Yes that is correct.
Perfect. Can I assist you with anything else today?
No that will be all for now. Thank you.

That question does not make sense to me.
