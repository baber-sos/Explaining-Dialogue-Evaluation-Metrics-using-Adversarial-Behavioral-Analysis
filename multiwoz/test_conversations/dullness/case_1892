Okay, not problem. Would you like to travel by train or taxi? Where are you departing from?
Train, Monday, to Broxbourne from Cambridge.
Is there a time you need to leave or arrive by?
I need to leave Cambridge after 21:15
There are two trains you can take on Monday, either the 22:01 (arrive 23:01) or the 23:01 (arrive 24:01). Which train do you prefer?
Thank you that will work fine for me and my husband
