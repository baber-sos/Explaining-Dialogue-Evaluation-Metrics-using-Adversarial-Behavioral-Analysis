I am looking for a train leaving on Tuesday.
Sure, what stations are you traveling between?
I'm leaving from Leicester and should arrive in Cambridge by 13:45.
There are 7 trains that match your request. The first train leaves at 5:09. Do you want me to book that train or do you want information for other trains?
That's fine. I don't need a booking yet. You've given me the departure time. May I also have the ticket price and travel time, please?
Certainly. The travel time is 105 minutes and the price is 37.80 pounds. Is there anything else I can assist with?
I would like to visit a college in the city center.
I'd recommend christ's college. Would you like some information on it?
Yes. The entrance fee and the phone number please.
