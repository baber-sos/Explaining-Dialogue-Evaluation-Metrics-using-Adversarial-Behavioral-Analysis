Could you help me find a cheap hotel in the center of town?
I have two options to offer you, the 4 star Alexander Bed and Breakfast and the unrated El Shaddai. Would you like me to book you a room at one?
Great can you find one with free parking and a 0 star rating
The El Shaddai meets your needs. Would you like to book a room?
At the moment, can I just get the postcode and it is a hotel?
Sure, the postcode is cb11eg. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I just want to confirm that it is actually a hotel, as opposed to a guesthouse?
