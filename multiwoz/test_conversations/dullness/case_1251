I'm planning a trip to Pembroke College.
Great! Pembroke College is in town. What information can I help you with?
I'd like to know what type of attraction it is, the entrance fee, and what area it's in, please.
It is a college in the centre of town. There is no entrance fee. May I help you with anything else?
I'm looking for a train to Cambridge leaving after 19:30.
What day of the week are you traveling and what is your departure station?
I want to depart from Norwich on Friday.
TrainID TR5291 departs at 20:16. Their price is 17.60 pounds. Would you like to book this train?
What time does the train arrive?
The TR5291 arrives by 21:35.
That sounds perfect. Can you go ahead and book that for me?
