I want to find a European restaurant in the west.
There is one available, the cambridge lodge restaurant, would you like me to book you?
No, I'm just getting some information together. Is it expensive?
Yes it is an expensive restaurant, do you want to try a different restaurant?
Let's go with Cambridge Lodge. I'd like to book for 8 at 17:30 on Saturday, please.
Reference number is : IPXE2SID . Is there anything else?
actually, i want to change the reservation to sunday.
Reference number is : ISJVY1RC . Is there anything else?
I am also looking for a hotel, it can be expensive, but it needs to have free wifi.
There are five expensive hotels, all with wifi. Could you tell me which location you are wanting to stay in, to narrow it down?
The area doesn't matter, which one would you recommend?
Sure, I would recommend the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel which is located near the restaurant. Would you like a reservation?
No thanks, just tell me the phone number and type for it please
It is a hotel and the phone number is 01480446000.
How many stars does this hotel have?
It is a 4 star hotel.
I need a taxi to go between the two places, I need a contact number and car type please.
I'd be happy to help with your request. First I'll need to know where you're departing from and what time you'll need picked up?
I need the taxi to pick me up at the hotel and take me to the restaurant by 17:30.
Your all set a yellow audi will be picking you up the contact number is 07509141470, is there anything else you'll be needing today?
