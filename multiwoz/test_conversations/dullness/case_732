I'd like to find a hotel with free wifi and free parking, please.
I can help you find this information! Did you have a particular area of town in mind?
Cambridge, in the east with a 4 star rating I am sparing no expense.
There are lots of 4 star lodgings, but they are all guesthouses rather than hotels, and they all have cheap or moderate prices. Would one of those be okay?
Yes I just am looking to get the phone number of one.
Allenbell's phone number is 01223210353.
Thank you so much. I would also like help finding a train to Cambridge on Tuesday.
There are 202 trains coming into Cambridge on Tuesday. Where will you be departing from?
I will be leaving leicester and would like to arrive by 20:45 in cambridge.
I have train tr6932 leaving at 6:09 and arriving by 7:54. Would you like me to book it?
