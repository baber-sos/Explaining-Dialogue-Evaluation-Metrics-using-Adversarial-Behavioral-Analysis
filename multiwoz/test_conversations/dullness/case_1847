I am looking for a place called the holy trinity church.
It is located in market street.
Can I get information on area and entrance fee?
The Holy Trinity Church is in the centre of town and the entrance fee is free! Want more information?
Can you tell me what trains go to Bishops Storthford and leave on Saturday?
We have ten trains every two hours starting at 05:29, any time preference?
I need it to depart after 11:15.

I don't have a good answer to that.
