Can you help me book a train? I would like to leave after 10:15 on Saturday.
I can help with that! What are your departure and arrival stations?
I'm coming into Stansted Airport and i want to go to Cambridge. Is there a train for that?
TR6310 leaves Cambridge at 10:24 QM on Saturday. It costs 8.08 Pounds. Would you like me to book that for you?
No, thank you.
Is there anything else that I can assist with?
How long is the ride?
