Hello. I'm looking for a cheap place to eat in the centre. Can you help me?
There are 15 places do you have a food preference?
Yes, I'd love Chinese.
There are 3 Chinese restaurants meeting your requirements. May I recommend one for you?
Sure, pick your favorite and let me have the address, postcode, and phone number please?
