I'm trying to find an Italian restaurant in the city centre.
What price range are you looking at?
I would like a expensive price range.
How about caffee uno. there are also 3 others.
That sounds interesting actually. Can you give me the address and phone number perhaps?
Sure, they are on 32 Bridge Street City Centre and their number is 01223448620.
Great can I also get some information on the huntingdon marriott hotel?
Huntingdon Marriott Hotel has 4 stars and is located in the west and is in the expensive price range. They have internet and parking.
