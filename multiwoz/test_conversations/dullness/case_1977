Hey I'm trying to find a train that leaves on monday to Kings Lynn.
Are you departing from Cambridge?
Yes. I am departing from Cambridge.
I found 19 trains running between those 2 stations that day. Would you like to leave at a certain time?
No but I need to arrive by 17:00.
I have train TR7964 leaving at 5:11 and arriving at 5:58.
How much travel time is involved with this train? I also need a Mexican restaurant in the expensive range.
I can process one request at a time. The train is about an hour.
I need the exact travel time please.
