I want to visit some architecture.
If you come to the centre of town there are several magnificent churches. And the Old Schools are quite impressive as well. Would you like more information about any of them?
Is there a phone number I can get for the schools please
The phone number for Old Schools is 01223332320
Thank you! I also need to find a place to eat while there. Something expensive.
There are many fine expensive restaurants to choose from. Do you have a preferred cuisine?
I'd like an italian restaurant in the centre of town.
We have a few of them, is there a certain area you'd like?
I would like to dine in the centre part of town.
How about clowns cafe?
Sounds good. Please book a table for 2 on Monday at 19:30.
I'm sorry but there is no availability for 2 people for that day and time. Would you like to try another day or time slot?
Could you try 18:30 instead please?
