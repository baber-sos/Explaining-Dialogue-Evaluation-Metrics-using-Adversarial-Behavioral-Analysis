I'm planning a trip to Cambridge and am looking for a place to dine.
There are many great places to dine in Cambridge. To help narrow it down, what area are you looking for and what type of food?
I'm looking for an Italian restaurant in the north.
I have one place. Would you like me to book it?
Sure, I need a table for 4 on Saturday at 16:00 please.
