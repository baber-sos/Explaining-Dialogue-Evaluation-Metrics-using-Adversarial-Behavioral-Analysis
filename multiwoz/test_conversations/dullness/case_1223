I hope you can help me find the attraction downing college.
Yes, it's on Regent Street in the centre of town. Would you like the phone number?
No. That will be all, thank you. Good day.
You're welcome. Goodbye.
Oh, wait, one more thing. Can you help me find a train?
Sure! When are you wanting to travel, where are you leaving from, where would you like to go and what time?
I am traveling on Sunday from Peterborough to Cambridge. I want to arrive in Cambridge by 15:00.
