Are there any hotels with a star of 4 I can stay at?
Yes, there are 21 4 star hotels to choose from, do you have a price range in mind that you'd prefer?
Yes, are there any in the moderate price range?
I found 11. Would you like to specify an area?
Don't care. I am looking for free parking at the hotel though. Which ones have that?
There are 5 hotels would you like a certain area?
Just pick one of the hotels. I just want a guesthouse.
Might I suggest the Limehouse. They offer free parking and free internet. They are located in the north at 78-80 Milton Road. Would you like to book a room?
Yes, please. I also need a train on Tuesday.
I can help you with that, but first, I'll need more info. What are your departure and arrival locations?
