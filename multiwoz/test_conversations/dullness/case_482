I am looking for a place to stay. The hotel should be in the cheap price range and should be in the north
Okay. There is a 0 star place, and a 4 star place. Which do you prefer?
I don't care as long as it's cheap.
I think the Worth House is your best bet!
alright. book that one for me
Are you booking for one person? When is your arrival and how long is your stay, please.
Yes, only one person. I will be arriving on Sunday, for one night.
I'm sorry I don't have anything for Sunday night. Would you like to try a different hotel?
I don't need a booking after all, sorry. Are there any cheap guesthouses in the north with free wifi?
Yes, there i the worth house and also city centre north b and b. Would you like me to book you a room at either one?
