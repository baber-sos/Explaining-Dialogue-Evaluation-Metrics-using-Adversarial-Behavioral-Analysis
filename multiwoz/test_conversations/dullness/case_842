Need restaurant in the east, expensive is what i'm looking for
I have five, what type of food?
Could you recommend one with the food type?
Royal Standard is a great gastropub place.
Excellent. Let's go with that.
Would you like me to book it for you?
No thanks, I need a train from Cambridge to Stevenage that arrives by 08:00 on Saturday. Is there anything like that?
There is a train Id TR3259 leaving at 6.10. Do you want it.
Yes that sounds good, albeit a bit early. Can you book tickets for 4 people on that one, please?
