I am looking for a cheap guesthouse to stay in for my trip to Cambridge.
I have 9 entries matching your request. Do you have a preference for area?
Preferably in the west side of town. I would also like something 4-star rated if possible.
There are 7 guesthouses that meet your criteria. Might I recommend alexander bed and breakfast?
Does it have a 4 star rating and internet?
