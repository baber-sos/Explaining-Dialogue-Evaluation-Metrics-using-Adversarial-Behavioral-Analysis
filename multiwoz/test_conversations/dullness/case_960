I'm looking to book a ticket for a train that leaves stevenage after 09:45.
Thank you so much. Have a nice day
did you book the ticket and if so, how much does it cost?
The first train to leave stevenage after 09:45 leaves at 09:54 and costs 12.80 pounds. Would you like me to book that for you?
Yes please. I need the booking for 8 people, and I would like a reference number.
