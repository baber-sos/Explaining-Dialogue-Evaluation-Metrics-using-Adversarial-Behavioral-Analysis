Yes I am looking for an expensive restaurant in the South of town.
I have many. Do you have a preference for type of food served?
Sorry, Actually I need an expensive restaurant in the north. the first on your list would be great.
Sure how about Saigon City?
Sounds great, can you book a table for 5 at 18:00?
Alright, which day would you like the reservation to be on?
Actually, I won't be needing a reservation just yet. Could you verify the type of food Saigon City serves?
Saigon City serves asian oriental cuisine. Would you need anything other information or assistance?
Yes, could I get the restuarant's phone number and postcode?
Certainly. The phone number is 01223356555 and the postcode is cb41nl. Anything else I can do for you?
No, that's it. You've been very helpful, thank you!
