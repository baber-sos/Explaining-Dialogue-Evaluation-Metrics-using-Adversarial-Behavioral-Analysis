i'd like to suggest to you all saints church entrance there is free
Great, can I have the address and postcode?
Of course. The church is on Jesus Lane and the postcode is cb58bs. Can I help you with anything else?

I'd like to go from Cambridge to Ely, and I need to be there by 18:00 for a wedding I'm attending.
