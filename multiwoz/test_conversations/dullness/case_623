I'm looking for some hungarian food restaurants near the centre, please.
I am sorry there are no Hungarian Restaurants near centre.
What kind of expensive restaurants are in the center of town?
Unfortunately there aren't any Hungarian places. Do you want to try other cuisine types?
yes let me see the options
There is a variety of choices; Chinese, African, British, Italian, American, Gastro Pub, etc... Do you have a preference?
i want indian food.
Curry Garden is a nice place would you like that info ?
Yes can I get a address and phone number please?
Certainly, the phone number for the Curry Garden restaurant is 01223302330 and the address is 106 Regent Street City Centre. May I help you with anything else today?
