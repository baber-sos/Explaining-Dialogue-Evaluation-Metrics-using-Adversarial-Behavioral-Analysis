I'm looking for info on expensive south indian restaurants in Cambridge.
I am sorry but I have no listings for expensive South Indian restaurants. Is there another choice you would like?
Are you sure? Could you please check again?
There are no south indian restaurants. There are indian restaurants available though. Would this b e okay?
No how about British food instead?
There are a number of expensive british restaurants in cambridge. Do you have an area in mind?
The restaurant should be in the east.
The Grafton Hotel Restaurant meets all of your criteria! Would you like to book a table?
