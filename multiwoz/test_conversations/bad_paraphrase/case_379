I'm looking for a restaurant that serves vietnamese food on the south side of town, is there anything like that?
There are no Vietnamese restaurants on the south side but there is one on the west side. Would that suffice?
What about on the east side? I would like for it to be expensive.
I'm sorry but there are not any Vietnamese restaurants on the East side of town, either.
Bummer, how about Indian food on the east side? I'm willing to pay for an expensive meal, if it's good!
There are 4 Indian restaurant on the East side ranging from moderately priced to expensive. Do you have a price preference?
