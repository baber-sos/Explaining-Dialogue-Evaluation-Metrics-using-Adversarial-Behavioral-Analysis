Hi, I need a train on Sunday leaving peterborough.
I have 38 trains leaving peterborough on sunday. Where are you headed?
I am hoping to arrive in cambridge by 12:30.
I have 13 trains meeting your criteria. The first leaves at 05:19 and leave every 30 minutes after. Can I book one of them for you?
What is the one with the shortest travel time?
All the trains take exactly 50 minutes. What time would you like to depart?
Hm, I'll take any train that will let me arrive by or before 12:30.
Booking was successful. Departs at 11:19 and arrives at 12:09, that will be 13.2 GBP payable at the station, your reference number is QS1AJEL1. Anything else I can help you with?
I need a hotel, one with free parking.
There are a lot of possibilities here but none indicate free parking, just whether they have parking or not. Could you list places with free parking?
