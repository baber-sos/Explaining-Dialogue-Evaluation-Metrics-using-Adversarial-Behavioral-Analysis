I am looking for a museum to go to in Cambridge.
You're in luck! Cambridge has a great number of museums. Did you have an area in mind?
Perhaps the center of town. Can you provide me with information regarding the entrance fee and a telephone number too?
The broughton house gallery is located in the centre is free to enter and the phone number is 01223314960. Can I help you with anything else?
Yes, I need help finding a place to eat. I would like it to be expensive.
