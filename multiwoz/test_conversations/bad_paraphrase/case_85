Hello! Can you give me information about trains going to Cambridge and leaving on Wednesday?
There are over 200 trains leaving. Do you have a specific time you'd like to arrive by?
I am looking to depart from steveage and leave after 11:15 please.
The first train after 11:15 is the TR6473, leaving Stevenage 11:54, arriving Cambridge 12:43. Would this be to your liking?
Yes please can you book seats for 4 people and give me the reference number?
Your booking was completed and the total fee is 51.2 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : HHBT7E2N .
I also need a place to stay. Can you recommend an expensive hotel in the north?
Unfortunately there are no expensive hotels in the north. I could check another area if you would like.
Are there any expensive places to stay in the north? It doesn't need to be a hotel, but I would like free parking.
Unfortunately, there are no hotels available with your preferences. Would you like me to find you one in a different price range or area?
