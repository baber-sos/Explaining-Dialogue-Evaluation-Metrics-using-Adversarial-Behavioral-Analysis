I'm trying to find a hotel called Allenbell. Can you help?
Yes Allenbell is located on 517a coldham lane in the east. Would you like me to book a room for you?
book for me bed and breakfast for five people from tommorrow.
How many days will you be staying?
Actually don't book it just yet on second thought. Can you advise how many stars it has and the price first?
The Allenbell is a 4 star guesthouse in the cheap price range.
I need a a restaurant. The restaurant should be in the west and should serve italian food. The restaurant should be in the moderate price range
