Hello there, I am traveling to Cambridge soon and I am looking for a play to stay in the north side of town.
There are 13 places to stay. Do you have any other requirements outside of the north area?
Yes, i need a 4 star hotel that also includes free wifi.
How about the acorn guest house at 154 chesterton road?
