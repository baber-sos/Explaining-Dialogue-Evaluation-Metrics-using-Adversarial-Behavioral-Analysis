I am looking for places to go, do you have any attractions in the west part of town?
I have several museums and a few colleges to choose from. Which would you prefer?
I think I would prefer a museum.
The Museum of Classical Archaeology would be a fun place to check out, would you be interested?
Sure, give me their phone number. I'd also like to find an expensive restaurant in West Cambridge.
Here's the number for the Museum of Classical Archaeology, 01223335153. How does the Cambridge Lodge Restaurant sound for you?
That sounds good. Could you reserve a table for 3 on Friday at 19:00? Can I get a reference number? Thank you!
It's all booked reference number is 8L9SAXV0
I also want to book a taxi to go from the museum to the restaurant.
When would you like to arrive by?
I would like for the taxi arrive by 19:00 please. Can you give me a contact number and the car type for the taxi as well?
