Hey I am looking for a train from Cambridge to Bishops stortford. Mind helping out?
many trains are leaving on friday. mind choosing the time?
I want to leave on Monday and arrive by 18:45.
I have train TR4283 that leaves cambridge at 5:29 and arrives in bishops stortford at 6:07. Would you like to make reservations?
Could you give me the travel time and price of that train please?
The cost is 10.10 pounds. The duration of the trip is 38 minutes, leaving Cambridge at 5:29 and arriving at 6:07 in Bishops Stortford.
I also want a cheap chinese restaurant.
There are four great restaurants to choose from. Do you prefer one on the south side of town or in the centre?
