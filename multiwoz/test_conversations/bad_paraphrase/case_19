I am looking for a place to go!
I can certainly help you find something. Do you have a type of attraction in mind?
I like looking at the architecture of old buildings. I think it says a lot about how we used to live.
We have a lot of interesting architecture here in Cambridge. Is there a particular area of town you're interested in?
What would you suggest?
Here are a few suggestions from the centre: All Saint's Church and Holy Trinity Church, both are free to visit.
The Holy Trinity Church sounds lovely. Can you give me their postcode, please?
Yes, their postcode is cb23nz. Can I get any other information for you?
No that will be all. Thanks.
You're quite welcome. Thanks for contacting the Cambridge TownInfo Centre and have a great day!
