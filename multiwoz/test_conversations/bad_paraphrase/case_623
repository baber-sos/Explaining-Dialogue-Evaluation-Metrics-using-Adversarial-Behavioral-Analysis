I am looking for a Europeon restaurant in the west of Cambridge.
Ok, I found the Cambridge lodge restaurant. Would you like to make a reservation?
Is that an expensive restaraunt? I really need someplace expensive, it is a special occasion for me.
I'd suggest cambridge lodge restaurant on Cambridge Lodge Hotel 139 Huntingdon Road City Centre, cb30dq. Would you like me to make a reservation?
