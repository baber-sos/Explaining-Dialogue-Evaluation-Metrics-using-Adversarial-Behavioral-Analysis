Hi, I am looking for a place to stay in Cambridge. I will need free parking.
We have 29 locations that fit your criteria. Are you looking for a particular price or any other kind of accomodations?
How about something expensive with a 4 star rating?
In the 4 star expensive range we have huntingdon marriott hotel, and the university arms hotel. Would you like to book one of them?
Actually I'm looking for a guesthouse. Do you have one that has 4 stars and free parking?
There's nothing fitting those criteria. I do have 9 moderately priced guesthouses with free parking. Or would you like to change something else?
A moderate priced one is fine. Please give me the postcode phone number and area.
I have the acorn guest house on the north side 154 Chesterton road cb41da, would you like me to book this location?
