I need a train to London please.
Can I have a departure site, date and time you are leaving?
I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me. I'm just looking for a museum in town.
Okay, we've got about 23 museums in town, any particular type of area?
I do not have any preference on the area. Can I have the phone number and entrance fee to one of the museums?
Sure, the Broughton House Gallery is free to enter, and their phone number is 01223314960. Can I help with anything else today?
I'm also looking to find an Italian restaurant that is cheap to eat at in the north part of town.
We only have da vinci pizzeria, would you like me to book a table?
Yes, thank you. I need to reserve a table for 1 person on Wednesday at 18:15. Thank you. I also need the reference number.
I was unable to book that time. Is there another time we could try that would still suit you?

I was ineffectual to hold that time . Is there another meter we could stress that would still fit you ?
