I need a train that will be in Cambridge by 3:00
What day will you be travelling?
I will be travelling on Wednesday.
Alright, where will you be departing?
I'm leaving out of London King's Cross.
What time do you need to be there by? Is it 13:00?
No, I need to arrive by 14:00.
I have only one train that would be close to those traveling times. It leaves London Kings Cross at 11:17 and arrives in Cambridge at 12:08.
Can I get a ticket for 1 person and the reference number please.
