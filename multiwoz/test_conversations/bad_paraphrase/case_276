i am looking for a swimming pool in the south part of town.
I am sorry, there are no swimming pools located on the south side. Would you be interested in visiting a different attraction?
How about a cinema instead?
Cineworld Cinema in the south side is located at Cambridge Leisure Park, Clifton Way CB17DY and their phone number is 00872208000. Is there any other information I can get you?
