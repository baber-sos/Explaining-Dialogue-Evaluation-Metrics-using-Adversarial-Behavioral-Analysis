I need a place to stay in the east.
Of course! We have multiple places to choose from. There is one hotel and the rest are guest houses. What kind of price range are you looking at?
It should be an expensive 2 star hotel.
I can recommend Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge. Would you like to book it?
Yes, please. It will be for myself and I'll need it for 5 nights starting on Monday. I will also need the reference number when you have it.
Excellent. Your Booking was successful. Reference number is : CXCS0GLB . Do you need anything else?
I'm also looking for a restaurant. The restaurant should serve chinese food and should be in the same price range as the hotel.
i got 9 in my data base. is there a specific area you prefer?
Any area would be fine. As long as it's Chinese cuisine in the expensive price range. Perhaps you could recommend one.
I personally like Yu Garden. It's in the East. Would you like to book a table?
Sure, book it for the same amount of people at 13:15 on the same day please.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : WKT2SY2H .
I will need a taxi to get me there, and to my hotel Please find a taxi that can arrive before my booked time, Please Provide Contact Info And Car Type.
