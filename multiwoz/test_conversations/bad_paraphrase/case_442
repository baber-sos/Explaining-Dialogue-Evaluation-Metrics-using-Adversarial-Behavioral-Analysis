I am looking for information in Cambridge
I'm happy to help you with that. Is there something in specific I can tell you about?
I'm staying in the west and I want to find a place near here that serves real British food.
Saint johns chop house is in the moderate price range serving British food.
Cool, could you give me the phone number?
Yes, they can be reached at 01223353110, is there anything else that I can help with?
I also need a train for Thursday.
Okay, I am happy to help with that. Can you tell me your destination and where you'll be departing from?
I'll be departing from norwich, and will be going to cambridge. I'd like to arrive by 12:30.
the train arrives at 11.35
Ok, can I get the train ID.
The train that arrives at 11:35 is the TR6655. However there are other options if you prefer a different time.
That time is sufficient.
Okay! Would you like for me to book you a ticket?
Yes, I sure would. That would be fantastic.
How many tickets will you be needing?
I'm sorry, I actually don't need it to be booked at this time. I just realized I have other things to figure out first. That will be all thank you!
