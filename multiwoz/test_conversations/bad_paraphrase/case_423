Can you help me find a moderately priced place to stay?
sure, i have 18 options for you
Thank you! I would like a 4-star hotel, please.
the a and b guest house is located in the east and is a 4 star.
I'd prefer a moderately priced place in the north.
There are 7 guesthouses in the north part of the city that fit your needs. Do you have any other requirements, such as parking or internet?
No not at all. I just need to know if they have internet and what the postcode and phone number is for one of them.
