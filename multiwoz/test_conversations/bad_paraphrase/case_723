Can you help me find a restaurant for from trip?
Do you have any food preferences?
I would like some Italian food.
There are 15 italian restaurants. Is there an area and/or pricepoint you would like to stay in?
Yes, I'd like a moderate price range, and a restaurant on the south side.
I have just one place available. It is Pizza Hut Cherry Hinton. They are moderately priced and are located at G4 Cambridge Leisure Park Clifton Way Cherry Hinton.
