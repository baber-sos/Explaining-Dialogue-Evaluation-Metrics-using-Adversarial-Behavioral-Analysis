I need information about a certain restaurant called charlie chan.
Charlie Chan serves Chinese food and is located in Regent Street City Centre (centre area). The phone number is 01223361763. Do you have any other questions?
Yes, could you please give me the specific address of the restaurant?
Yes, it's located at Regent Street City Centre cb21db. May I help book a table?
Maybe later. I also need to find a train to ely on Tuesday. Can you help with that?
I can absolutely help! Where are you departing from and when would you like to arrive?
I will be leaving from Cambridge and need to leave after 12:30 please.
There is a train that fits that criteria leaving at 09:50 and arriving at 10:07, would that work?
I really can't leave at that time. Like I said, I need something that leaves after 12:30.
My apologies. How about this: TR3420 leaves Cambridge at 13:50 and arrives in Ely at 14:07. Would this be better?
Yes I would like reservations on train TR3420.
How many tickets will you need?
One ticket please, thank you.
Booking was successful, the total fee is 4.4 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : CKPZRG81 .
