Can you help me find a train departing from cambridge going to kings lynn?
of course, what day are you traveling?
I want to leave on Thursday and arrive by 14:00.
We have nine trains arriving by 14:00 that day. What time are you looking to leave by?
I don't have a specific time to leave but I do want to arrive before 14:00. How much will this cost?
The price is 9.80 pounds per ticket. would you like me to book you passage?
