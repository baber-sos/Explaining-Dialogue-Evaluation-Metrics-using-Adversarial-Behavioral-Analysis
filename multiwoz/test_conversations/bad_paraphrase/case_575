I'm looking for a place to eat in the east that is expensive.
Sure, we have british, chinese, gastropubs, and indian restaurants. Would you like to book a table at one of them.
How about an expensive British place? I'd like a reservation for Wednesday.
okay, I have the Grafton Hotel Restaurant. What time would you like me to book your reservation?
I would like a table at 14:00 on Wednesday for 5 people.
Unfortunately they did not have that day and time available. Would you like to try for another date or time slot?
