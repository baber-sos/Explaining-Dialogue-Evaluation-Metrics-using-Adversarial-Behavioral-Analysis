I'm looking to go somewhere in the centre to enjoy some entertainment. Can you help?
I can't find any entertainment venues in the centre. Would you like to try something different? A museum perhaps?
No museums, what colleges are there around town?
Sure, there are 13 colleges in that area.
can i please get the phone number, postcode and entrance fee?
Christ's college is one I would recommend, their phone number is 01223334900, post code is cb23bu, and there is no entrance fee. Can I help you with anything else?
I also need a train that leaves on Monday and arrives by 14:15.
Where are you traveling from? There are 5 trains from london kings cross that arrive by that time.
