I need a train that leaves on wednesday after 12:30.
I'm happy to help! Could you let me know where you would like to depart from and what your destination is?
I am departing from birmingham new street and my destination is cambridge.
I have 12 trains that leave after 12:30 that day. Did you want to leave at about 13:40? That train arrives at 16:23 and costs 75.10 pounds a ticket.
Yes, thank you.
All set! Your reference number is 9P2D9ORJ .
I am also looking for a certain hotel in the area. It is called the Lovell Lodge. Do you have information on that?
