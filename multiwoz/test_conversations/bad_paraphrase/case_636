I am looking for something to do, preferably on the west side of cambridge; perhaps a museum of sorts.
There are 7 museums, I'd recommend cambridge book and print gallery.
Thank you, either one will be perfect. Can you choose one and get me the phone number, please? Oh! And the entrance fee, too.
Cambridge Book and Print Gallery is free to enter, and their number is 01223694264. Can I help you with anything else today?
Yes, have you heard of the Hobsons House Hotel?
The Hobsons House hotel is located in the west at 96 barton road postcode cb39lh. The phone number is 01223304906. Would you like me to book a room?
Yes. Please book me a room for 4 nights starting Monday. We have 5 total guests. I also need a reference number please.
Your reservation was successful. Your reference number is O88L1FJB . Can I help you with anything else today?
I will need a taxi to take me from the museum to the hotel. I am planning on leaving the museum at 11:15.
