Hi, can you give me some information on places to stay on my trip?
I can we have 33 places to stay, do you have any pricerange or area you'd like to stay?
I'd like one in the expensive price range that includes free wifi.
The University Arms Hotel is very nice and includes free parking as well as wifi. Does that sound good?
Sounds good, could you book me a room for three people for three nights starting Thursday?
