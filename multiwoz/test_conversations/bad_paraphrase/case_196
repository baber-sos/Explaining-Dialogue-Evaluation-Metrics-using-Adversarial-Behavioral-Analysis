I'm looking for a place to go for entertainment in town.
Which specific area of town are you interested in ?
No I don't have an area preference.
I have 5 entries. Would you like to try whale of a time in the west?
Can you tell me the entrance fee and phone number?
Unfortunately I don't have any information on their entrance fee, but the phone number is 01954781018.
