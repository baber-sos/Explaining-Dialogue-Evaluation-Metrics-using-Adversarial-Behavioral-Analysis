I'm looking for a place to stay during my upcoming trip to Cambridge.
I can definitely help you with that! What area are you staying in, and what's your price range?
it should be located in the west and should be cheap.
I have two options for you, and they are both 4 stars: Finches Bed and Breakfast is a guesthouse and The Cambridge Belfry is a hotel.
