Yes, as long as its leaving Cambridge on friday....thank you
How many tickets would you like?
5 tickets. Can you please also provide the reference number?
Booking was successful, the total fee is 50.5 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : 3R5W0FNB . Is there anything else I can help with today?
I would like to find a German restaurant in the center of town.
I'm sorry, there are no results for a German restaurant in the town centre area. Would you like me to look in other areas, or try for another cuisine?
What options are there for moderately priced restaurants at the centre?
There are 21 various restaurants in town centre. Possibilities include british food, asian oriental, italian, turkish, international. Do any of those sound good to you?
