I am looking for something to do, preferably on the west side of cambridge; perhaps a museum of sorts.
There are 7 museums, I'd recommend cambridge book and print gallery.
Thank you, either one will be perfect. Can you choose one and get me the phone number, please? Oh! And the entrance fee, too.
Cambridge Book and Print Gallery is free to enter, and their number is 01223694264. Can I help you with anything else today?
