I'd like to find a resturant that serves cheap Chinese food!
Charlie Chan is located in the centre and it is cheap! Would you like me to book it for you?
Yes, go ahead and book it and please send me the address.
The address is Regent Street City Centre. What day and time would you like to book? How many people?
I do not need to book it. What is the postcode and the area please?
