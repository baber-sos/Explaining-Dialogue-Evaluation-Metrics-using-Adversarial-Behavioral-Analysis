I need to find a place to stay that includes free parking and is moderately priced.
I have many guesthouses and hotels available. Do you have a preference on the number of stars or location?
No star preference, but I would like it to be a hotel type.
There are two hotels that fit your criteria: the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge. Which would you prefer?
The Ashley Hotel will do fine. Can you book me a room there? It will just be myself staying.
