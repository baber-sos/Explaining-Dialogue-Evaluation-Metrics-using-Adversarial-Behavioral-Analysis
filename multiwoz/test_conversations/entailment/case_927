I would like to find out where the El Shaddai hotel is please.
It is at 41 warkworth street.
Thanks, do you know what area in the city they're located? I could also use a phone number if you have it on record.
The El Shaddai hotel is located in the center of town. Their phone number is 01223327978. Can I help you with anything else?
Do you know of any museums I can go to?
Yes I have many to choose from. Is there any type of museum you are particularly interested in?
I don't know, can you recommend something that sounds fun?
Cambridge Artworks looks fun! It's located at 5 greens road.
What is the museum's phone number?
The phone number is 01223902168. Can I provide you the post code or entrance fee?
No, thanks. I have all the information I require.
Fantastic! I hope you have fun!
I sure will! Have a nice day.
Thanks you too!

I have two choices in the west. One is in the cheap price range and the other is expensive. Do you have a preference?
