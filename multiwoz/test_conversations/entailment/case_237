Hi! Can you help me find some places to go on the south side of the city? I'm super bored!
I am happy to help. There are several types of places to go in the South. Parks, theatre, cinema, museum, nightclub. What sounds good to you?
I don't have a preference. Could you make a recommendation?
How about a nightclub or cinema? There's also a great museum.
Anything is fine whatever is most popular.
Sure, Cineworld Cinema will be great. What information do you need about this attraction?
