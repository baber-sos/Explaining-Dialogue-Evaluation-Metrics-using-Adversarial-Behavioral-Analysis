I'd like to find out if there are any cheap portuguese places to eat in Cambridge.
Yes, I have Nandos located in the South and Nandos City Centre located in the Centre. Will one of these work for you?
Yes, I will make a reservation at Nandos in the south part of the city for five people on Thursday.
I can certainly help you with that. What time would you like the reservation?
I would like the reservation to be at 14:45.
Your reservation reference number is : SMH06MS1 . The table will be held for 15 minutes from the time of your reservation. May I assist you with anything else?
I need a place to stay as well. I need free parking.
