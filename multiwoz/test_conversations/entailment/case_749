Hey, can you help me out? I am looking for something to do. What kind of entertainment is out there in the center of town?
There are no entertainment attractions in the centre of town. Would you like to look in a different area?
That's not necessary. Are there any colleges in that area instead?
There are 13 colleges in town centre. Gonville and Caius college is on trinity street with free entrance. Do you want more information on any others?
That actually sounds great. Could you give me the phone number for Gonville and Caius college?
The phone number for the Gonville and Caius College is 01223332400. Can I help you with anything else?
Actually, yes. I am looking for a cheap place to stay with free parking.
What part of town would you like to stay in?
I would prefer the East side.
There are several guest houses on the east side. Do you need free parking or internet?
Yes, both please. I'm looking to get a room just for me for 2 nights on Friday at a place that offers wifi and parking free.
I am sorry, but that was not successful. Would you like to pick a different day or shorter stay?
How about one night?
Great! You're booked at Autumn House for one night. Your reference number is N4TVFKGS . Would you like more information?
I'd also like a taxi between the places if possible.
