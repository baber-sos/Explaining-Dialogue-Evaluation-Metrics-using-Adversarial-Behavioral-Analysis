Hi, I am trying to plan a trip and could use some help with the trains.
Okay sounds great! Where are you headed?
I'm leaving Cambridge and heading to Peterborough Wednesday after 18:45.
The TR8199 leaves after 19:06, would you like me to book you?
Yes, please book it for 4 people.
I was able to book it for you. Your reference number is DQDGTDH8 . Is there anything else I can help you with?
I also want to go to a museum in the center part of town.
I have several places. Did you have one in specific in mind?
Not really, do you have one to recommend?
The Broughton House Gallery is nice and has no entrance fee. Would you like the address or phone number?
