I am looking for a swimming pool to visit on the north side of town. Can you help me with that?
There are two swimming pools in the north, Jesus Green outdoor pool and Kings Hedges Learner pool. Would you like the addresses?
No, just the entrance fee please. I think I am more interested in Kings Hedges.
I don't have the entrance fee listed here.
Do you have any contact information for these pools I could have to get the entrance fee?
Yes, their phone number is 01223353248
Thanks. I also need to get some information on trains for Saturday. London Liverpool St to Cambridge.
To narrow down the search, do you know what time you want to leave or what time you want to arrive by?
Yes, I'd like to arrive by 20:00 if possible.
I have a train that arrives at 19:07. Would you like me to book it for you.
I'd like to have the train ID and the travel time please.
The Train ID is TR8530 and it will leave at 17:39. Would you like me to book that for you?
