Hello, I am traveling to Cambridge and am really excited to eat at some local restaurants when I am there. Can you help me find a place to dine?
Definitely! What type of cuisine and price range are you looking for?
I was hoping to find something expensive, preferably Italian food.
We have 5 listings for expensive Italian restaurants. Do you prefer a certain area of town?
Yes south please.

Yes. Friday. 4 people. 14:30.
