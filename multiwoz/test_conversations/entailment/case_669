I don't have a specific time to leave but I do want to arrive before 14:00. How much will this cost?
The price is 9.80 pounds per ticket. would you like me to book you passage?
No thanks. Not at this time. Can you help me find a room to stay that is moderately priced?
There are a lot of moderately priced hotels. Do you have a preference on which area?
