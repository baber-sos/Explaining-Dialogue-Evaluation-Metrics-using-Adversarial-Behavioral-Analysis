I need train reservations from norwich to cambridge
I have 133 trains matching your request. Is there a specific day and time you would like to travel?
I'd like to leave on Monday and arrive by 18:00.
There are 12 trains for the day and time you request. Would you like to book it now?
Before booking, I would also like to know the travel time, price, and departure time please.
There are 12 trains meeting your needs with the first leaving at 05:16 and the last one leaving at 16:16. Do you want to book one of these?
