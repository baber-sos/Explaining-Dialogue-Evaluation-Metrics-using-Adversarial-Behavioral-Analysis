Can you find me a theatre?
Would you like the mumford theatre?
Yes and I need to know the entrance fee, address, and phone number
The fee is not listed but the address is anglia ruskin enterprise, east road and the phone number is 08451962320. Can I help you with anything else?
I am also looking for a French restaurant in the expensive range.
I have two excellent options. Cote is in the centre of town, would you like me to reserve you a table?
I am not sure how many people will be coming, so I will do that later. But can you provide me with their postcode and phone number?
Absolutely. Their postcode is cb21uf and they can be reached at 01223311053. Would you also like me to find you an attraction nearby?
No, that's everything I needed today. Thank you!
Ok, thank you for calling. Goodbye.
