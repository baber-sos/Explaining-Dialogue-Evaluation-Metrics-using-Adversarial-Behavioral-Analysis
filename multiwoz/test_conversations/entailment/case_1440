I am looking for corsica restaurants in the east of cambridge, can you help me?
Unfortunately there is not a corsica restaurant in the east of cambridge, is there another type of food you would like to look for?
I'll think about it. I would like a moderately priced restaurant, I know that.
How about curry prince? It is a moderately priced indian restaurant in the east.
Curry Prince sounds terrific. I'll try that out. Thank you for the information! Goodbye!
Would you like me to make you a reservation?
Yes please, for 7 at 11:45 on Thursday. And may I have the reference number?
