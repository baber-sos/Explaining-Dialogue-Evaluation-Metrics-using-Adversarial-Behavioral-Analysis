I would like for you to find a train that leaves on wednesday after 16:45.
Okay, let me look that up for you. Do you have a destination or a departure site?
I'm going to cambridge from leicester.
The TR1745 leaves Cambridge at 17:21 and gets into Leicester by 19:06. Will that work for you?
Yes, that will work. For 4 people, please.
Reference number is : Y9AWF9YJ . Will you need anything else?
Do you think you can find me a great italian food place. I want something really fancy. It's for an anniversary dinner.
