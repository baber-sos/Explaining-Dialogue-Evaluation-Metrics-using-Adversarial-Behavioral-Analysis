i am planing a trip to cambridge and i need ideas on a place i can go in the centre
There is much to choose from in the centre. There are several architecture attractions to explore, boats and swimming, colleges, museums, parks, theatres and even nightclubs.
What do you recommend?
I recommend Whipple Museum of the History of Science. It's educational and free!
Okay that sounds fun.
Is there anything else I can help you with today?
What can you tell me about the Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge?

I have a train leaving Cambridge at 17:40 and arriving at the airport at 18:08. Can I book that for you?
