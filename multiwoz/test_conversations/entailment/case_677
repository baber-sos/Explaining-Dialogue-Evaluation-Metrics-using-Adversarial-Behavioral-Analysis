I am looking for a restaurant called golden wok.
The Golden Wok is a moderately priced Chinese restaurant in the north. Would you like the address or phone number?
Actually I know exactly where it is and would appreciate you booking a table for 2 at 18:15 on Monday.
Alright, I have booked your table on Monday for 2 at 18:15. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I will need the reference number please.

I found two attractions that match your request: Cherry Hinton Hall and Grounds and Funky Fun House.
