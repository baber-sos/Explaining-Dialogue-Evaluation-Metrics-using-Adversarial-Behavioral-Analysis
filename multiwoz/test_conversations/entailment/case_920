Can you find a theater to go to in town?
Sure, do you have an area of town you would like to visit?
No, I'm not concerned about that.
Adc theatre is in the centre of town
Okay, great. I'm also looking for a restaurant in the south. It should be expensive.
There are 5 locations. Do you have a food preference?
