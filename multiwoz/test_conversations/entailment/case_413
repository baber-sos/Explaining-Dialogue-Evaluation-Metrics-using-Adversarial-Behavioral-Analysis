Hi! Are there any asian oriental restaurants in the center of town?
I have 4 different options for you. Did you prefer a certain price range?
Something moderately priced would be great.
The yippee noodle bar is an asian oriental restraunt in the town centre with a moderate price. Would you like to make a booking?
Yes I need a table for 4 on Saturday.
