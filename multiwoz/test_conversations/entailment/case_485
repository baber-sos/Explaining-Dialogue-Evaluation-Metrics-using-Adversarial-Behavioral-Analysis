Hello, I am looking for a train that arrives by 16:00 and leaves on monday.
There are multiple trains available to you. Where are you departing from and what is your destination please?
I want to broxbourne from cambridge.
We have trains leaving from 05:01 every hour until 14:01 that will get you to Broxbourne by 16:00. What time would be more acceptable to you?
Once you find the train you want to make a booking for 1 people. Make sure you get the reference number
The TR0796 train leaves Cambridge at 05:01 and arrives in Broxbourne 06:01. The cost in 17.90 pounds. Is this a good train for you?
Yes please. Please book a ticket for one person.
The booking was successful your reference number is XUKSDFW4 . Is there anything I can help with today?
Yes. I would like a restaurant for the same day. The name is Travellers rest.
