Hello. I really need to find a cheap place to stay in the east. Is there anything like that?
I've found three, all of them are guesthouses and all of them have free internet and parking. Would you like me to give your their information?
Sure, that sounds great.
Okay I will give you the information I have on them.
Can you book it for 8 people for 4 nights starting on thursday?
Ok I have you booked at The Allenbell for 4 nights for 8 people. Your reference number 7SN0BAAT . Do you need anything else?
I would like an indian restaurant in the same price range as the hotel please.
There are four cheap Indian places, three in city centre, and one on the north end.
Whichever one is fine, surprise me!
I would recommend Royal Spice in the north end. Would you like me to make a reservation there for you?
Yes I need it booked for the same group of people at 12:45 on the same day.
That booking was successful. The reference number is KAY2S45O . Is there anything else I can do for you?
Yes, I would like a reserve a taxi to commute between The Allenbell and Royal Spice. I really want to be on time for our dinner reservation.
What time would you like to be picked up?
