Can you help me find a college?
Sure! We have 18 colleges in Cambridge. Is there a particular area of town you'd like to be in?
I'd like to stay close to the action in the centre of town.
May I recommend Christ's College? It is in the centre of town and there is no entrance fee.
i would love to have the phone number, address, and postcode.
Yes their phone number is 01223334900 and their address is saint Andrew's street and their postcode cb23bu. Anything else?
Yes, I also need a train for sunday.
I need more information. Where will you be departing from, and what is your destination?
I'll be coming into Cambridge from Bishops Stortford, and I want to arrive around 10:15.
Train TR4803 would meet your criteria. Can I book something for you?
Yes please book that for me.
How many people would you like to book for?
Actually,no, I just need more information. You've given me the train ID. I need the travel time and ticket price.
It's a 38-minute ride, and tickets are 8.08 Pounds. Can I help you with anything else?
Nope. I do not want to book or anything just looking into it. Bye. Thanks.
