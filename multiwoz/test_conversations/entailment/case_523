Thank you! I do not care about the price range.
How about peking restaurant?
Great, could we have a table for 8 on monday at 17:00?
Your table at the Peking Restaurant is booked, ref #N2XF9GWQ . Can I help you with anything else today?
Yes, I need a guesthouse with free wifi.
There are 23 guesthouses with free wifi. Would you like to stay in the south near the restaurant?
Yes please, and I'll need free parking as well.
I think allenbell would fit your needs. Want me to book it?
Well how many stars does it have?
My apologies. Allenbell is not in the south. However, I highly recommend the 4 star Aylesbray Lodge located in the south and moderately priced. Can I help you with your booking?
How many stars, also the postcode and address? I will also need a taxi and want it to arrive by 17:00. Contact number and car type.
It is four stars. 5 Mowbray road. Shall I book it?
just find me the postcode and address.
The address is 5 mowbray road in the postcode, cb17sr. Do you still need a taxi?
Yes. I'm leaving Aylesbray Lodge and need to be at Peking Restaurant by 17:00. Please get me the contact number and car type.
I've booked you a yellow BMW departing the guesthouse and arriving and peking restaurant prior to your 17:00 reservation. You can reach the driver at 07462630170.
Thanks. That is all for today.
