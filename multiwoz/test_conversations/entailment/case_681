Hi there. Can I get some help finding a hotel or guesthouse please?
Sure thing! What side of town would you prefer? What price range would you like?
I need one in the moderate price range. I would like one that doesn't have free parking.

Yes, that would be great. I'll need to book for Friday, 3 people, and for 3 nights.
