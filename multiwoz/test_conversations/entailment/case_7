I need a five starts hotel close to a mall and main restaurants. The hotel should include free wifi in the room.
I'm sorry, but there are no 5-star hotels anywhere in Cambridge. Would you like to broaden your criteria?
How about something with 4 stars and something expensive.
I have 2 options for you - The Huntingdon Marriott on the west side, and the University Arms in the center. Are you interested in one of these?
Maybe. Is either one a 4 star hotel? If so, I'd like to book a room for 4 nights.
Both are 4 stars. How many days would you be staying, and how many people are in your party? I can see if something is available.
I need a reservation for 4 nights starting Saturday.
How many are in your party?
3 people. Can I get the reference number please?
I'm sorry, but there is nothing available at that time at either hotel. Would you like to try fewer nights or perhaps a different arrival day?
Will you try Sunday arrival?
Yes, I tried Sunday but it isn't available. Can you shorten your stay at all?
Yes, can you try it for 3 nights, please.
Neither hotel appears to have three days available starting on Sunday for three people, can I look something else up for you?
I may have been confusing you. Could you try and book a 4 star, expensive hotel for 3 nights, starting on Saturday? 3 people. Wifi please.
Sure. I was able to book you for the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel. Reference #IHGCTXH9 . Anything else I can help with?

Sounds good, I changed my mind about the internet, can you let me know if it has free wifi?
