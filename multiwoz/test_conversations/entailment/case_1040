The area doesn't matter. I don't need internet and I need to book it for 1 person.

The Alpha-Milton guesthouse was booked for you successfully. Your reference number is XQY0ITE2 . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Yes, I'd like to know if there are any places in town in the south that is the type of multiple sports?
There are no multiple sports in the south, but there are multiple sports in the east. Do you want to stay with an attraction in the south?
A park will be okay, just looking for somewhere to get exercise on the trip.
