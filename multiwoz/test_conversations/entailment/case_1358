It is a college in the town centre, address Jesus Lane. Postcode is cb58bl and it has free admission.
Do you happen to have the telephone number for the college? I would like to call the main office there.
I can certainly look that up for you. Ok, it's 01223339485. Do you need any more information or something else I can help with?
Thank you. I'm also looking to leave on Tuesday by train. Arrival will be Stansted Airport.
Where will you be departing from and when would you like to travel?
I'll be departing from Cambridge. Departure time doesn't matter, I'd just like to be there by 17:45, please?
