I'm looking for a place to dine on the south side of town. Please find a place that's in the expensive price range.
I found five expensive restaurants on the south side of town. Would you prefer Chinese, Indian, Italian or Mexican?
Do you have a favorite you could recommend? I will need the phone and postcode and food type also please.
If you ask me, the Chiquito Restaurant Bar serves the best Mexican food around. Their postcode is cb17dy. You can reach them at 01223400170. Can I help with anything else?
No, that will be it. Thank you for your help.
