I'm looking for a place to go in Cambridge. Perhaps an architecture attraction.
There are 5 architecture attractions in the centre. WIll one of those work?
Yeah, could you recommend me one?
Holy Trinity church is beautiful.
Could you tell me what area it's in, and if there's an entrance fee?
It is in the centre of town.
Is there an entrance fee?
No, they have free entry there. Is there anything else I can help with?
Can I get some help finding a train to Peterborough on Thursday?
There are many trains to peterborough. What is your departure station and what time do you want to depart/arrive?
I will be leaving from cambridge and leave anytime after 13:00
Do you have a time that you could like to arrive by?
any time on thursday.
How about the 13:34 that would arrive at 14:24?
Sounds perfect. Can you book one ticket please?
