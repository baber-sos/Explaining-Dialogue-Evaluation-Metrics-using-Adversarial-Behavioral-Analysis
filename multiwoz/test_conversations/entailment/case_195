I'm looking for a train to leave from stantsted airport on monday.
Okay, there are several trains available.. looks like they are all going to Cambridge. Is that where you would like to go?
Yes. Is there one that leaves after 11:15?
Yes, there are five trains that leave after that time. Is there a time you would like to arrive by?
