Please help me find a restaurant.
I can definitely do that. Did you have a type of food or a price range in mind?
Moderately priced Northern European cuisine, please.
I'm sorry I have no listings for moderately priced Northern European cuisine. Could you reconsider your price range or food type?
Sure, can you find me another restaurant that serves Indian food?
I have many what area can I look in?
Any area of town is fine.
Would you still like a restaurant in the moderate price range? I would recommend the Curry Prince.
Yes. May I have the post code for that place?
The post code is cb58jj.
I would also like to find someplace to visit in the centre of town.
What type of attraction are you interested in visiting?
Can you make a recommendation and provide entrance fee, postcode, and address?
Do you have any interests for attractions?
Can you make a suggestion?
Club Salsa is pretty rad. It's at 1 Station Road.
