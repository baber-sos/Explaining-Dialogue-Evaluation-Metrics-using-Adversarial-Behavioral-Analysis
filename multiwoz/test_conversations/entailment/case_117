Hi there. I'm hoping you can help me. I am looking to try molecular gastronomy food. Might there be a restaurant like this in the centre of town?
Sorry but there aren't any molecular gastronomy restaurants in any part of town. Would you like to try something else?
Yes how about gastropubs or international in the moderate price range.
We have the cow pizza kitchen and bar located in the center of town in the moderate price range. Should book you in?
Is that a gastropub?
Yes indeed. I can make a reservation if you'd like.
What is their address?
They're located on Corn Exchange Street, cb23qf. Can I help with anything else today?
