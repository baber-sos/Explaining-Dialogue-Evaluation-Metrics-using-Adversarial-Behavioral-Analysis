I need to find a restaurant in the centre.
Do you prefer a particular type of food or are you looking at a specific price range?
I would like British food. I have no preference of price range.
There are 7 restaurants which meet your needs. The Copper Kettle is located at 4 Kings Parade and serves moderate priced meals. would you like to make reservations?
Yes I need a table for 6 Monday at 18:15.
Your table for 6 is reserved for Monday at 18:15 and they'll hold your table for 15 minutes. Your reference number is T67ZV5US . Can I help you with anything else today?
I am also looking for an attraction, some type of boat.
I have 4 listings. One in the east, north or 2 in the centre. Would you like more information on one of them?
