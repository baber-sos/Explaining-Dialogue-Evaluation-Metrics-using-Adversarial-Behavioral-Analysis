I am looking for the gardenia restaurant a friend told me to try.
Your friend has good taste. It is located at 2 Rose Crescent City Centre, postcode cb23ll.
I'd like to book a table for 7 people on Monday at 15:15 please.
No problem! I've booked you a reservation at the gardenia for Monday at 15:15 for 7 people. The reference number is 3B3402QR . Is there anything else?
Thank you. Can you help me find a place to go, maybe something to do with architecture?
Absolutely. There are five in the centre, four churches and one old school. Would you like more information on any of those?
I would like the post code for the old school
The postal for old schools is cb21tt, can I help with anything else?
That's all for today! Thank you so much, goodbye!
You are welcome, have a great day.
