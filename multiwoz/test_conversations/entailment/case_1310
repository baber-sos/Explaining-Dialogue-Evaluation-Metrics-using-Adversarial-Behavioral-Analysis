Hi, are there any trains from cambridge to kings lynn?
I have 133 results for trains going from cambridge to kings lynn, what day are you looking to travel on and what time would you like to arrive?
I need to leave on friday and arrive by 16:45
I have one that leaves at 14:11 and arrives in kings lynn at 14:58. Would this be acceptable?
Yes, I'd like eight tickets, please.
Great, your 8 tickets are booked (Ref#PHXZ03NH). Total fee is 78.4GBP, which you'll pay at the station. Can I help with anything else today?
Yes I need to find a nice expensive British restaurant please.
