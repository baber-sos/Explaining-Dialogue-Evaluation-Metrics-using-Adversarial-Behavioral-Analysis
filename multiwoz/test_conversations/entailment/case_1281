Hello, can you help me find a train that leaves after 16:00? The train should also leave Kings Lynn too. Thankyou.
Absolutely, what day would you like to leave?
I would like to leave on Friday.
I'm going to need your destination preference also, please.
I'm going to Cambridge.
TR0864 is closest to when you want to leave. Would you like me to book it?
Yes please, and please send the reference number. I am also looking for a college in the west to visit. Can you please find one for me.
How many tickets do you need me to book for you?
just one ticket
Your reference number is 4QINITRF and you'll owe 9.8 GBP when you arrive at the station. I'll search for a college for you to visit.
Thanks, can I have the address and postcode for the college you find.
Sure, there are actually a number of options. Is there a specific area of town you would like to visit a college?
