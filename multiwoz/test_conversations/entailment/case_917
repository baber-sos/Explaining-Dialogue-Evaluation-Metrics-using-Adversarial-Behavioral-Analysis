Hello, I am looking for a Korean restaurant in the centre. Could you help me with that?
I have one restaurant name little seoul in the expensive price range. would you like me to book it?
Are there any other choice? If not I would like to get a table on Wensday at 12 for 1 please.
I looked and this was the only restaurant serving korean food. I have booked you a table. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Ref# WH331DNY . Any thing else?
Are there any places to go in the same area as the restaurant?
There are dozens of places to go in city centre. What type of attraction are you interested in today?
I don't really mind, as long as it is near the restaurant. What looks good to you?
I would like to suggest all saints church located in the centre. Is that okay?
Yes that is fine can you please provide the postcode?
The postcode is cb58bs. Is there anything else I can help with?
I also need a taxi to go between them and need it to arrive at the restaurant by the booked time.
