I'm looking for an Indian restaurant, preferably in the centre of town.
There are a number of options for Indian restaurants in the centre of town. What price range would you like?
I would prefer cheap restaurants.
I was able to find three options in your price range, may I recommend The Gandhi?

Absolutely! Saigon City is an asian oriental restaurant in the north. It is a little expensive but worth it. It's located at 169 High Street Chesterton. Their phone number is 01223356555.
