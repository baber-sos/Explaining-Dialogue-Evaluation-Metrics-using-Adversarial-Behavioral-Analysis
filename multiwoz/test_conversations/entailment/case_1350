I'm looking for a restaurant in the centre of town
There are over 60 restaurants near the center of town, do you have a cuisine or price range in mind?
Yes, something in the affordable price range. Also, do any of them serve singaporean food?
There are no Singaporean restaurants, but there are cheap ones offering several different cuisines.
Okay what about Italian food then?
Zizzi Cambridge serves italian cuisine in the city centre. Would you like a reservation?
Not right now, but can I have their postcode, please?
Their postcode is cb21ab
Thank you. I am also looking for some places to go. Can you help with that?

I only have one venue offering cinema in the centre but it has a different postcode than the restaurant. Vue Cinema's postcode is cb11ps. Should I look elsewhere for cinemas?
