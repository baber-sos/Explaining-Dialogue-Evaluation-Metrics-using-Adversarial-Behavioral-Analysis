Need a train to cambridge leaving after 11:45.
We have quite a few trains available. What day are you wanting to travel on?
I would be leaving on Wednesday. I would be leaving from London Kings Cross.
A train is departing London Kings Cross at 13:17 to Cambridge. A train will depart every two hours after that time. Would you like to book a train?
Yes I would like to book for 2 people.
I have booked your train. Your reference number is 9V6DOMNZ and the fee of 47.2 is payable at the station. Can I help with anything else?
