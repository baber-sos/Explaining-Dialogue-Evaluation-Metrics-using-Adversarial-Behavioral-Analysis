I am looking for a museum in the west to go to.
There are 7 museums in that area, did you want something with no entrance fee?
Yes, please. Can I get the address and postcode?
There are six free museums in the area. Are you interested in archeology, art exhibits or galleries? There is also a Cafe gallery.
I am most interested in a museum. Can you send me postcode and address. I also would like a cheap catalan restaurant, please.
Well, we have many museums. The Cambridge and County Folk Museum, for instance. Or the Museum of Classical Archaeology. What interests you?
I'll try the Folk Museum. Where can I find it?
The Cambridge & County Folk Museum costs 3.50 pounds entrance and is located at 2-1 Castle Street. Their phone number is 01223355159.
Could you also provide the museum's postcode please?
Yes, the post code is cb30aq
I'm also looking for a cheap Catalan restaurant.
I'm sorry, we don't have one. Will some other type do?
Yes, can you find a Chinese food restaurant in that post code instead?
I'm sorry, we don't have one. Will some other type do?
Are there any Italian places in town?
There is one Italian restaurant located in the same area as the museum. It is called the La Margherita. Would you like to book a table?
