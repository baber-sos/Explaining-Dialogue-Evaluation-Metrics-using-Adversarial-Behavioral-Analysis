i am looking for a train from cambridge that should arrive by 08:00
Sure, where would you like to travel to, and which day?
I am trying to get to london liverpool street on saturday.
The TR2895 leaves Cambridge at 05:59 on Saturday and arrives at London, Liverpool Street at 07:27. Would you like to book a seat on this train, or keep looking?
No, that will be all. Thanks, goodbye.
Okay, have a great day!
I'm sorry I also needed a place to stay!
Alright, what type of accommodations are you looking for?
I'd like a hotel with free parking, please.
There are many options available, any other specific preference
Free parking within the hotel would be great and free wifi.
Ashley hotel looks like it has good value, would you like to book there?

I think I'll go with whichever one is latest. Can I have the price and departure time for that train, please?
