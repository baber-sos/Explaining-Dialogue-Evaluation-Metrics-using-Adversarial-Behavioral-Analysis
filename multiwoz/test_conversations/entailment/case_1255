Hello! I am looking to book reservations at Sala Thong.
Ah yes, I have that right here. It's an expensive Thai restaurant in the west end. How many people would you like to reserve a table for, and what day/time?
That's all the info I needed. Thanks.
Are you sure you don't need help with anything else?
I'd also like to know if there's a swimmingpool in the east.

I can book you a taxi, can you tell me the arrival or departure time?
