Hello there! Can you tell me if there are any 4-star hotels or guesthouses in Cambridge that are cheap?
There are 21 locations, do you have any other requirements?
I am hoping it is a guesthouse
There are 7 guesthouses meeting your requirements. Is there a particular area you wish to stay in?
No, as long as it's cheap and have 4 stars. Can you recommend me one and book it for 8 people and 3 nights starting Thursday?
Sure the Autumn House is a personal favorite. Your booking was successful.
Great. What was the reference number for the booking?
