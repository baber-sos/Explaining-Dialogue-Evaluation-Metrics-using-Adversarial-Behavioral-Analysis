I'm looking for a place to go for entertainment in town.
Which specific area of town are you interested in ?
No I don't have an area preference.
I have 5 entries. Would you like to try whale of a time in the west?
Can you tell me the entrance fee and phone number?
Unfortunately I don't have any information on their entrance fee, but the phone number is 01954781018.
I am also looking to eat Basque food in the moderate price range.
There is no restaurant offering basque food in the moderate price range.

Actually, can you suggest one of them. Can I get their contact info as well?
