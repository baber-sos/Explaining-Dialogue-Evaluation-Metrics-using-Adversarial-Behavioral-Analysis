I need to find a guesthouse with a 3 star rating
We have four such guesthouses. Do you have a preferred location?
No, I don't. I want one that includes free wifi.
Bridge Gue House, Hamilton Lodge, and Hobsons House are all available if you'd like one of those?
Please book the Hamilton Lodge, for 6 people.
I'd be happy to. How many nights would you like to stay? And I'll need to know the day you would like to start your stay.
I'll be staying 2 nights starting on wednesday. Oh, and there are 6 of us.
I'm sorry, my reservation attempt was unsuccessful. Will another day or length of stay work?
Can you try the same parameters at another hotel?

I am. It is a great portuguese place. They have two locations in town. One in the South and on in the city centre.
