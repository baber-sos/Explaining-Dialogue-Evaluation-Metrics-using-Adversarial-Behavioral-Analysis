Hi, are there any local theatres around town?
We have 4 theatres in the centre, and 1 in the south.
What's the address for the one in the south?
The theatre is on clifton way.
What is the cost of admission?
The Junction is the theatre in the south, but I don't have the admission listed in my database. You could phone them at 01223511511 for that information.
Ok. Pick one of the other 4 theaters you mentioned.
We have no entrance fee information for any of the theatres at this time. Can I help you with anything else?
