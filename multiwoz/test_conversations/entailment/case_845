Hello, I'm looking for an attraction in the type of theatre.
There is the ADC Theatre, Cambridge Arts Theatre, Mumford Theatre, The Cambridge Corn Exchange, and The Junction. Which would you like to know about?
Could I get the postcode and entrance fee for the Mumford Theatre please?
i don't know the entrance fee but the postcode is cb11pt
I also need an expensive restaurant in the east.
There are plenty of expensive restaurants on the East side but if you tell me what kind of cuisine you're interested in, I can narrow it down and recommend one.
