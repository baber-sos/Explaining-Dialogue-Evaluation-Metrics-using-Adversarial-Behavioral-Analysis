Hi, could you tell me some attractions in Cambridge?
Hello, there are some wonderful museums and most of them are free entrance. We have Holy Trinity Church located on Market St.
A swimming pool sounds like much more fun, doesn't it?
There are four pools, abbey pool and astroturf pitch, jesus green outdoor pool, kings hedges learner pool, and parkside pools. Which would you like?
Any one of those is fine. May I get the entrance fee?
I'm, sorry, but the entrance fee is not listed. Would you like a phone number for one of them?
Yes. I am also looking for a train, leaving on Friday after 10, depart cambridge, going to leicester.
TR5648 will be departing cambridge Friday at 10:21, and arriving by 12:06 in leicester. Would you like to book a seat for this train?
That will work. Can I have this booking for six people as well as the reference number please?
I've booked that. Your reference number is 0ICM79OM .
Great thank you that should be all
