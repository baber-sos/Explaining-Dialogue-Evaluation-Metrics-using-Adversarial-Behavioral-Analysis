I would like for you to find a train that leaves on wednesday after 16:45.
Okay, let me look that up for you. Do you have a destination or a departure site?
I'm going to cambridge from leicester.
The TR1745 leaves Cambridge at 17:21 and gets into Leicester by 19:06. Will that work for you?
Yes, that will work. For 4 people, please.
Reference number is : Y9AWF9YJ . Will you need anything else?

Yes, the Autumn house is on the East part of time, the prices are cheap and it's four stars. Is there anything else you'd like to know?
