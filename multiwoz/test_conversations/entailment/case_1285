I'm places to go, can you point me in the right direction?
what type of attraction do you want?
I want to go to a museum.
There are several what area are you wanting to go to?
Any place in town is fine for me. Do you have any recommendations?
I suggest the byard art museum located in the south.
That sounds great. What is the entrance fee?
Their admission is free. Is there anything else you need to know?
Yes please. I need an expensive guesthouse that has free parking please.
I'm sorry I don't have anything in that category. Can we check something else?
Do you have a guesthouse in the moderate price range with free parking?
I have several in the South closer to the museum, and some in the North. Do you have a preference?
No I don't. Can you pick the best one please. I need a room for 2 and 4 nights starting from Wednesday.
