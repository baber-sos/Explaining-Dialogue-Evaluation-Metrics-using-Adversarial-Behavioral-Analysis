whats their postcode?
Their postcode is cb17sr. Would you like me to make a reservation for you?
Yes please make a reservation
For how many rooms and how long is your stay going to be?
Ignore that, I just need to get a train leaving after 21:45 from cambridge
There's a train that leaves at 23:51, would you like that?
Not sure. I need to go to King's Lynn on Saturday. Does that train go there?
The earliest train is at 22:11. Does that work for you?
It certainly does. Can you book for 3 people, please?
