Hi, I'm looking for a hotel called aylesbray lodge guest house. Do you have anything with that name?
We do have a hotel with that name. It is in the south area and is moderately priced. Would you like me to book this for you?
Can you confirm if this is a guesthouse or hotel? Do they have free wifi?

Thanks for the booking. I would also like to see more of the west of Cambridge, particularly some type of an attraction.
