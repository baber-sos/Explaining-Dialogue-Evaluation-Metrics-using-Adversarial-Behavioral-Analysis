Hi, I'd like some information on nightclubs located in the west please.
My system is not pulling up any Nightclub attractions in the West. Is there another attraction type or area you would be interested in searching?
How about a college to visit in the same area.
Magdalene College is located in the west and is free to visit. Would you like more information on it?
What is the postcode there?
The postcode is cb30ag. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes I need a train that is departing on Wednesday from London Kings cross.

I'm going to book you for bridge guest house, but I need to know the number of days you plan to stay and the number of people with you.
