I am looking for a restaurant named The lucky star in Cambridge.
This is a chinese restaurant. It is located at Cambridge Leisure Park Clifton Way Cherry Hinton.
Can you book a table for me? Just for 1 on Saturday at 12:45.

Great. I'll also need a train to get me there from London King's Cross station.
The TR7309 leaves at 11:17 and arrives at 12:08, would that be one you'd like to book?
