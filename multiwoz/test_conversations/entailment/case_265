I am looking for things to do on the west side of Cambridge. Is there anything you can recommend?
There are 13 different attractions on the west side. You have your choice of colleges, an entertainment venue, and museums. Which would you prefer to learn more about?
The entertainment venue sounds like a lot of fun. What is the address?
An entertainment venue meeting your request is Whale of a Time. The address is unit 8, viking way, bar hill.
Perfect, thanks. Oh! I'm also quite hungry, can you recommend an expensive restaurant in town that serves molecular gastronomy cuisine, please?
Unfortunately, I don't have any restaurants that serve molecular gastronomy cuisine at the moment. Can I look for another type of cuisine for you?
Are there no molecular gastronomy restaurants in the West side or in the entire city?
Unfortunately there are none in the city. Would you like to try another type of food?

I think that will work. What is the departure time of that train?
