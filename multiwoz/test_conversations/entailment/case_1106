Can you give me information on an attraction called ballare?
The Ballare is located in Heidelberg Gardens, Lion Yard postcode cb23na, phone number is 01223364222. The entrance fee is 5 pounds.
Thanks. I'm also looking for somewhere to stay in the north. It should be in the moderate price range and has a star of 2 as well.
Would you want to try the lovell lodge, which is in the moderate price range and in the north.
