Hello I'll be coming to Cambridge and need a room to stay in. Can you recommend a guesthouse that has free parking?
I have 21 guesthouses in cambridge. What price range and what area were you looking for?
I don't have a price range in mind. But I would like a 4 star rating and somewhere that offers free parking.
Ok, there are 16 hotels that meet that criteria. Is there a particular area of town you're interested in?
No I don't care which area it is in, just so it is a guesthouse with free parking and 4 stars.
