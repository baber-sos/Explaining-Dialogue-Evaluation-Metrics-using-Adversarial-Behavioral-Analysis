Hello, I need to book a ticket going to Cambridge arriving by 16:30, can you help me with that?
There are a lot of trains available. Where are you departing from?
I'm departing from broxbourne on Friday.
TR2145 looks like it will get you there with plenty of time to spare.
Thanks, could you let me know the departure and arrival time?
Of course. It was actually the TR2144, my apologies about that.. It leaves at 14:32 and gets you there at about 15:32. It costs 17.90 pounds.
Excellent. I'm also looking for a particular attraction. It's called saint catharine's college. Any information?
Absolutely. It is a college located in the centre. It's free to enter and it is located on king's parade.
What is the postcode for Saint Catherine's College? I want to be able to enter the address into my GPS to get there.
Saint catharine's college is located at king's parade postcode cb21rl. It is free to get in. Do you also need their phone number?
No thanks, that's everything I need.
