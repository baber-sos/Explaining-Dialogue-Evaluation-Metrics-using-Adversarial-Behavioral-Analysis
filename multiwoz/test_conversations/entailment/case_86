I need a train to Birmingham New Strretm arrving by 16:45.
How does Friday sound? It will arrive by 16:23
I actually need it for saturday. If it can arrive by 16:23, that would be perfect.
Train TR3415 would leave at 5:40 and arrive in Cambridge at 08:23. Would you like me to book that for you?
Yes please, go ahead and book that.
I'm sorry, I was confused. You want to arrive at Birmingham New Street. I can book TR4975 for you, arriving by 7:44. How many seats do you need?
No never mind I just need to ask you about entertainment venues in town.
Sure, there are a few around town. What area are you interested in?
i think something in the centre of town would be good.
There is nothing that is in the entertainment category in the centre of town, can i try something else?
Yes, but first can we work out the train details? I still need more info on that TR4975 train. What's the departure time and travel time on that?
TR4975 leaves from Cambridge at 5:01, travels for 163 minutes, and arrives at birmingham new street at 07:44. It costs 60.08. Would you like me to book it?
No thank you. I would like to find something in the entertainment industry anywhere in the city.
There are 5 entertainment venues: Cherry Hinton Hall and Grounds, Funky Fun House, Nusha, Tenpin, and Whale of a Time. Do any of these interest you?
Whale of a Time sounds great. Can you tell me what area of town they are in? And the postcode please?
Whale of a Time is in the West and is in postcode cb238el.
