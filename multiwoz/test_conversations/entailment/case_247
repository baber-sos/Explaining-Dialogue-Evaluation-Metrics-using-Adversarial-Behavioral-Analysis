I'd like to find a restaurant that serves Mediterranean food and should be pretty expensive.
Both La Mimosa and Shiraz will meet your needs. Would you like to book a table at one of those?
Yes, can we get a reservation at Shiraz for 8 people on Friday at `17:15 and can I also get the reservation number? Thank you.
The booking for successful, it will only be reserved for 15 minutes. Your reference number is: JWUSOSWM . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
I am also looking for a train leaving Cambridge after 13:15.
There are 791 trains leaving cambridge after that time. What is your destination and day of travel?
My destination is Birmingham New Street and I would like to travel on Saturday.
