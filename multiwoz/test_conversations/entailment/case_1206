Yes, I would like an expensive hotel in the center and what type of attraction is in the area in walking distance?
Would you like me to find a hotel first or the attraction?
I'm actually looking for a train. I need to go from Kings Lynn to Cambridge on Tuesday. I need to leave after 19:15.
TR4809 departs at 20:11, would that work for you?

Thank you. That is all I need.
