I need a place to eat that serves chinese food.
There are 17 Chinese restaurants in town. Are you looking for a particular price range?
A moderate price range.
No we have narrowed it down to 4. Do you have a area preference?
Is there any located in the centre?
I found three Chinese restaurants that meet your requests. Would you like for me to book a table at one of them?
Yes, what are my three choices before we make a reservation?
The restaurants are: jinling noodle bar, lan hong house and shanghai family restaurant.
Can I book a table for 3 at Shanghai for Saturday at 19:45?
