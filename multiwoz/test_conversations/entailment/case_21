I need help finding an expensive place to eat in the west please.
There are many options for expensive food in West Cambridge. Is there a specific type of food you would like?
Yes, I would like eat Indian food, where I can eat Search Chicken Tikka Masala.
I'm sorry, there is nothing showing for Chicken Tikka Masala. There are however 5 expensive Indian restaurants in the west part of Cambridge. I would recommend the Rice Boat.
I'd like to book the Rice Boat for 1 at 11:45 on Monday.
You are booked for the Rice Boat on Monday at 11:45. Your reference number is S224QQ91 . May I help you with anything else?
No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help!
Thank you for using Cambridge TownInfo centre. Have a great day.
