I am looking for a restaurant serving chinese food in the centre part of town.
There are several chinese restaurants in the centre area. What price range are you considering?
I am looking for something expensive.
How about hk fusion located at 21 Burleigh Street City Centre? Would you like me to book?
That sounds great! Yes, please! Book a table for 3 people at 15:45 on friday.
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : CDBQYMUI . Is there anything else I can help you with?
That will be all. Thank you very much!
You are welcome. Enjoy the meal. Bye.
