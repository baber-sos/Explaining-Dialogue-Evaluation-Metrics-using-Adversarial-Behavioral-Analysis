Hi, I need a train that departs from bishops stortford and leaves on monday.
I have 10 trains available. What is your destination and preferred departure and arrival times?
My destination is cambridge and needs to arrive by 15:00.
I would recommend TR1827 which leaves Bishops Stortford at 13:29 and arrives in Cambridge by 1407.
What would the price range be for that?
