I'm looking for a Chinese restaurant in the centre of Cambridge.
There are quite a few Chinese restaurants in the area! Do you have a price range you'd like to stay within?
No, anything is fine. Can you suggest a great one?
Jinling noodle bar looks like a good place.
Can I have their phone number and address? Also, are there any trains that go from Peterborough to Cambridge?
sure no problem. Address is 11 Peas Hill City Centre and phone number is 01223566188. Would you like to book a reservation?

No thanks, but I do need some train info. I'll be leaving from Peterborough on Tuesday, sometime after 15:15.
