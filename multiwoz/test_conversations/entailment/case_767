Are there any Catalan restaurants in the centre of town?
I'm sorry, there are no Catalan dining establishments in the city centre. Would you like to look for a different cuisine or area?
Actually, can you try anything that serves French food?
I have the cote in the centre. It is in the expensive range. Would you like to make a booking?
Yes, please. I need a table for 8 on Friday at 17:30, please.
Ok, you are all set for cote on Friday, table for 8 at 17:30. Can I help with anything else?
Can I have the reference number for the reservation please?
Booking was unsuccessful. Can you try another time slot?
What about 16:30?

Thank you. Can you book a train for me? I'm leaving on Monday and I would like something that arrives by 12:15.
