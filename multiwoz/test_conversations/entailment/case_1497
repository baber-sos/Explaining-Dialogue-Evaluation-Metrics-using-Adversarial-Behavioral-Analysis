Would you be able to help me find a train for Friday?
Gladly. Where are you headed?
I need a train that departs Cambridge to Stevenage on Friday leaving after 18:30.
The first train running that route after 18:30 is the TR8118, leaving at 19:21.
That sounds great. Can you please book 5 tickets?
Booking was successful, the total fee is 64 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : QAF9QUO2 .
Okay thank you for your help.

I'm also looking for a cheap Catalan restaurant.
