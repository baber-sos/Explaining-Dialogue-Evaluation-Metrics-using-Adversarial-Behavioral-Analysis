I would to get a list of places to go in the center of town.
The Holy Trinity Church is a great example of architecture, Broughton House Gallery is a good, free museum, and the Cambridge University Botanic Gardens is a lovely park.
Can you provide the address and postcode for all of those suggestions? Thank you!
