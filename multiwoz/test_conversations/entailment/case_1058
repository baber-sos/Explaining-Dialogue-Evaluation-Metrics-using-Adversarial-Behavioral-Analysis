I need a place to eat that serves chinese food.
There are 17 Chinese restaurants in town. Are you looking for a particular price range?
A moderate price range.
No we have narrowed it down to 4. Do you have a area preference?
Is there any located in the centre?
I found three Chinese restaurants that meet your requests. Would you like for me to book a table at one of them?
Yes, what are my three choices before we make a reservation?
The restaurants are: jinling noodle bar, lan hong house and shanghai family restaurant.
Can I book a table for 3 at Shanghai for Saturday at 19:45?
Yes, I have made a booking for you. Your reference number is T30YC5TL .
thanks I need a 4 star guesthouse with free parking of course.
There are plenty of high rated guesthouse to choose from 16 in fact, any other preferences?
No, I don't. Any you recommend will be fine. I'll need it booked on the same day, same people, and for 5 nights.
Booking was successful. Reference number is : 3XXZNBWR
The reference number is great but it's going to be hard to find if I don't know the name. Can you tell me the name of the hotel?
acorn guest house is the name
