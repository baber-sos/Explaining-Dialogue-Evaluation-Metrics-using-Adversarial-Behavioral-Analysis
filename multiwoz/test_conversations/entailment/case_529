Yes hello! I'm looking for a train leaving on tuesday from norwich to cambridge.
There are a total of 133 trains traveling from Norwich to Cambridge. Is there a particular day that you would like to travel on?
I will travel on Tuesday to Cambridge from Norwich, and I need to arrive by 19:15.
Perfect. Did you have a departure time in mind? You could leave norwich as early as 05:16 or as late as 17:16 and still make it on time.
Earlier in the day is safer, thanks. I just need 1 ticket on the earliest ride.
I booked TR3932, reference number is FIW5ABO2 .
Thank you, I'm also looking for place to go in town, specifically the south. What kinds of things are there to do?
There are many attractions in that area. Would you prefer a museum, nightclub, cinema, theatre or park?
