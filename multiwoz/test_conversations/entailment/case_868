What restaurants in the centre serve international cuisine?
The Varsity Restaurant and the Bloomsbury Restaurant serve international food and are in the centre of town.
How about a place in the moderate price range?
Both of the named restaurants are in the moderate price range.
OK, can you book a table for 6 at 12:00 on Tuesday at The Varsity Restaurant? I will need a reference number too, please.

Thanks. Looking forward to it.
