i am planing a trip to cambridge and i need ideas on a place i can go in the centre
There is much to choose from in the centre. There are several architecture attractions to explore, boats and swimming, colleges, museums, parks, theatres and even nightclubs.
What do you recommend?
I recommend Whipple Museum of the History of Science. It's educational and free!
Okay that sounds fun.
Is there anything else I can help you with today?
What can you tell me about the Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge?

The police station is in Parkside, Cambridge. Their phone number is 01223358966. Is there anything else I can do for you?
