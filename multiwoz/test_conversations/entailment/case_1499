I am looking for a swimmingpool in town.
There are four public pools, one in the east, two in the north, one in the centre, any preferences?
I just need the address for one of them. I guess the one in the east will do.
Okay abbey pool and astroturf pitch is located on pool way, whitehill road, off newmarket road.
Okay, great. Thank you.
Is there anything else I can help you with today? A train, perhaps?
Yes, actually, a train would be great. I need a train that's going to Cambridge. I'd like to arrive by 13:00.
where is your departure site?
Yes, I need to leave on Thursday and am departing from London Liverpool Street.
