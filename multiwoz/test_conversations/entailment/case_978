Hello I'm looking for a cheap hotel that includes wifi.
I actually have just one located in the west that is cheap. It is the Cambridge Belfry. They are 4-star rated and offer free parking and wifi. Can I book you?
Great. I just needed to know one would be available if I decide to make the trip. You've been a great help. Thanks. Bye.
Thank you for contacting Cambridge TownInfo centre. I hope you have a pleasant trip! Goodbye!
Hold on, let me go ahead and book the hotel for 7 people starting on Tuesday for 5 nights. Please send me the reference number once reservation is made.
I have reserved the Cambridge Belfry for 7 people for 5 nights beginning Tuesday. Your reference number is G29ZSC5D . Can I help with anything else?
I would also like to see if I could catch a train from leicester to cambridge.
