I'm trying to find a 4-star hotel that's moderately priced please
Do you have a certain area you would like ?
No. but it should also have free wifi.
I was not able to find any hotels matching that requirement, is there something else you would like to try?
You don't have any moderately priced 4 stars with wifi?
We do have guesthouses available. Is that okay?
Yes if you can find a place for 5 people
I can help! for how many days starting when?
