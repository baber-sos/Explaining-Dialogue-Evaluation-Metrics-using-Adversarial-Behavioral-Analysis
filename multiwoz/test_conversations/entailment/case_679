Can you tell me about any hungarian restaurants in the centre?
I'm sorry I do not have any Hungarian restaurants in Cambridge. Is there another type of cuisine you might be interested in?
How about one that serves modern european food?
We have several in the center, and one in the south. They are in assorted price ranges. Do you have any preferences?
Whatever you recommend, please book me for 5 people at 12:15 on friday.
I have made a booking for De Luca Cucina and bar. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : 2X1IGK9D .
I also need to find a two star room.
How about the ashley hotel? They are moderately priced and have both internet and parking.
That sounds great. Could you give me the address please?
Sure, the address is 74 chesterton road post code cb41er. Would you like a reservation?
No thanks. I do want a taxi though to go from the hotel to the restaurant, arriving by my reservation time. Tell me the car type and contact number.
I've booked a grey bmw, phone number 07260290005. Will that be all?
That is everything, thanks for you help.
Great. Enjoy your stay!
