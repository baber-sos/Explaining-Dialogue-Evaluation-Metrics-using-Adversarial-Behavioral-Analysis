I'm looking for a restaurant that serves chinese food in the centre of town.
How about the Jinling Noodle Bar. I can reserve a table for you.
Is it expensive? I would like the restaurant to be expensive.
It is not, but the Ugly Duckling is. Would you like more information on that restaurant?
Please book a table for 7 at Ugly Duckling.
I'd be happy to! What day and time would you like for your reservation?
Please book the reservation for Thursday at 3:00pm and please provide me with a reference number.
Great it's all set RAQ4F5LX is the reference number
