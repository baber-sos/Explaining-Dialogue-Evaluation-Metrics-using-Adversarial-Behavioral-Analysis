I am looking for a train leaving on Tuesday.
Sure, what stations are you traveling between?
I'm leaving from Leicester and should arrive in Cambridge by 13:45.
There are 7 trains that match your request. The first train leaves at 5:09. Do you want me to book that train or do you want information for other trains?
That's fine. I don't need a booking yet. You've given me the departure time. May I also have the ticket price and travel time, please?
Certainly. The travel time is 105 minutes and the price is 37.80 pounds. Is there anything else I can assist with?
I would like to visit a college in the city center.
I'd recommend christ's college. Would you like some information on it?
Yes. The entrance fee and the phone number please.
There's no charge for entry and their phone number is 01223334900. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
NO, that is all. Thank you, goodbye.
