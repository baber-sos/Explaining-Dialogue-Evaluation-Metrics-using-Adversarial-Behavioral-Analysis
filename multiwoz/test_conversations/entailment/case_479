What are you specifically looking for?
a place to stay, moderate price range should have internet and 3 stars
I have 4 guesthouses available in the moderate price range. What part of town would you prefer?
The area doesn't matter. I don't need internet and I need to book it for 1 person.
Alpha-Milton guest house is in the north part of town has 3 stars.
