Can you locate for me a train that leaves on Tuesday after 3:15 PM? Thanks.
there is a train that leaves cambridge at 15:00 and arrives at london kings cross at 15:51 on tuesday.
That's too early. I need to leave after 15:15.
The next best option will be TR0945 which leaves Cambridge at 17:00 and arrives at London Kings Cross at 17:51.
Yes. Book that one for 8 people.

If you like parks the Wandlbury Country Park has free admission and is in the cb223ae postcode. Or I can tell you about the other attractions?
