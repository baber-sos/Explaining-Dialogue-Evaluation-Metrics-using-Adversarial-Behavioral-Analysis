I'm looking for a place to stay in the north maybe a guesthouse.
You're in luck! I have 11 guesthouses in the north, would you mind sharing your price range and any other preferences you may have?
I'd like a place rated 4 stars, that offers free wifi.
That narrows the selection a little. Do you need parking?
No I just need free internet. I also need the price range, address, and postcode of the one you find.
The avalon is a guesthouse in the moderate price range and is located at 62 gilbert road, their post code is cb43pd.
