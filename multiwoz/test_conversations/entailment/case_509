I would like to go to an Indian restaurant in the north.
I found 2 that matches your criteria. Would you prefer a moderate or cheap pricing?
How about the moderate one? May I have their address, please?
Yes The Nirala's address is 7 Milton Road Chesterton and their postcode is cb41uy. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
No, that is all, thank you. Have a nice day.
So glad we could help you out. Thanks for using the Cambridge TownInfo centre, and have a glorious day!
