Hi, I was going to visit the centre, and wanted to know if there were any professional or semiprofessional teams playing during my visit.
There are no sports places in the centre of town.
Okay. Are there any architectural attractions?
Yes, there are 5. I can highly recommend All Saints Church, it's beautiful.
The sounds great, can I get their address and postal code?
The address is jesus lane.
what's the postcode?
The postcode is cb58bs. Is there anything else I can help you with?
