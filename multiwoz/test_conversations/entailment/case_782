How about trinity college? 1 pound entrance fee.
Sounds good. That's all I need today, thanks!
You are welcome. Can I help you find anything else?
Yes I am looking for a particular restaurant called the Sesame Restaurant and Bar.
The sesame restaurant and bar serves chinese food. It is located in the City Centre and is in the expensive price range.
Thank you! Will you please tell me the address/postcode?
