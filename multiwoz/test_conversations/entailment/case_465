I would like help finding a train headed to Cambridge.
I will be happy to help you find a train. Can you tell me where you will be departing from?
Departing from London Kings Cross on Tuesday.
When would you like to leave or arrive by?
I need to arrive by 18:30.
Take Train TR1434 , which will arrive at 18:08. Shall I book you for that train?
Can I get the price for a ticket, first?
Sure! The ticket is 23.60 pounds.
Thanks! I am also looking for a hotel called Archway House. Can you tell me if they have free wifi?
They do. Would you like to book a room?
I would first like to know what their price range and hotel type are, thank you.
Archway House is a moderately priced guesthouse. Would you like their address or perhaps to book a room there?
Thank you, but no. You've already helped me with everything I needed today.
