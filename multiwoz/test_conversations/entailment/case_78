It should, how much is that ticket?
It would cost 16.50 pounds.

There are 3 options. Would you like a recommendation, or do you wish to add a specification?
I'd like a recommendation.
The expensive one is actually not much more than the other 2. I would highly recommend it. That would be at the Express By Holiday Inn Cambridge. It's in the east.
