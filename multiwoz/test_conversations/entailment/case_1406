Are there any parks in town, by chance?
There is one in the centre, one in the east, one in the north and two in the south. Will one of these work for you?
Could I get the address for the one in the centre?
Sure. The Cambridge University Botanic Gardens are located at Bateman Street.
i need its address and phone number.
The address is Bateman Street, postcode cb21jf and the phone number is 01223336265.
Thanks. I also need a place to get afternoon tea in the west.
