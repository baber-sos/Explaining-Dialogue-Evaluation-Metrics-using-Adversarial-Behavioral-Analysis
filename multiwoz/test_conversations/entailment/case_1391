Hello! Are there any colleges to visit in town?
There are 18. In what area would you like it to be in?
I don't care what area. I do need the postcode, entrance fee and area when you find one.
Christ's College in the centre of town has a free entrance fee and the postcode is cb23bu. What else can I help you with?
Im also looking for a cheap hotel with free parking.
That leaves us with about 10 options. Do you have a preferred area or price range?
As I said before, I'd like something cheap. Centre area is preferred.
There is Alexander Bed and Breakfast, 56 saint barnabas road. Inexpensive. Does that sound good?
Sure, can you give me their phone number?
Sure, their phone number is 01223525725.
