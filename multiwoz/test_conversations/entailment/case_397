I'm looking for some architecture in the west
I'm sorry, it appears the only architectural attractions in Cambridge are in the city center. Would you like info on any of them?
Do you have any attractions in the type of a museum then in the west area?
I have 7 in the west area. Would you like information about the kettle's yard or cafe jello gallery maybe?
Yes, can you tell me about the kettle's yard? What is the address and entrance fee?
It is free and the address is castle street.
Great, could I also find a moderately-priced Brazilian restaurant?
I'm having trouble finding one, would you like to try a different price-point or type?
Well, let's give Chinese food a try!
There are a few moderately priced Chinese restaurants in the centre of the city and one moderately priced in the North. Do you have a preference?
Nope can you choose one for me and book a table for 8 at 11:45 on Saturday?
Yes, I was able to book you at Lan Hong House in the centre, reference number IJ75KACV . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
