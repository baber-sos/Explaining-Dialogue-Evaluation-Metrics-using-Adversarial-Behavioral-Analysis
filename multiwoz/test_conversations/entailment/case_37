Are there any Modern European restaurants in the centre?
There are 4 available. Do you want to specify a price range?
Yes, I would like something in the expensive price range, please.
Darrys cookhouse and wine shop is the only expensive modern european restaurant. Do you want me to book it for you?
That would be great. Could you book me a table for 4 on monday at 19:45?
Your reservation is set, your reference number is EOMCTSEA
Great, thank you. Can you also help me find a train departing from bishops stortford for the same day?
Sure thing! Is there a particular time you'd like to leave or arrive by?
I would like to arrive in Cambridge by 15:00, please.
Okay, there are 5 trains arriving before 15:00, did you have a departure time in mind?
I think I'll go with whichever one is latest. Can I have the price and departure time for that train, please?
Sure, the train arriving at 14:07 will depart bishops stortford at 13:29. Total travel time is 38 minutes.
Okay thanks can you please give me the price?
The fare is 10.10 GBP. Can I be of any further assistance today?
That will be all. Thanks!
Thank you for choosing us. Goodbye!
