I would like to find an expensive turkish restaurant.
Wonderful! There's one I've found that's in the centre of the city. Would you like the address?
Yes I would like the address please!
The address is 196 Mill Road City Centre, post code cb13nf.
Thank you, that is all. Good day to you.
Thank you and have a great day!

That narrows it down to 2 choices. I have the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge. Both are hotels located in the north. Both have a 2 star rating.
