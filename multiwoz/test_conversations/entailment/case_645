Hello I'm looking for a cheap hotel that includes wifi.
I actually have just one located in the west that is cheap. It is the Cambridge Belfry. They are 4-star rated and offer free parking and wifi. Can I book you?
Great. I just needed to know one would be available if I decide to make the trip. You've been a great help. Thanks. Bye.
