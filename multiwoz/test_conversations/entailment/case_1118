Find me a Mediterranean restaurant in the centre of Cambridge.
The gardenia fits your criteria, can I book that for you?
Yes, please book that for me.
How many people and what time/day are you looking at?
I need the table booked for monday at 12:15 for 3 people. Thanks. Also could i get the ref #?
Booking was successful. Your reference number is: NZ89K99X, they will only hold your table for 15 minutes. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
Great I also am looking for a hotel to stay at that includes free parking. What's available?
I have found acorn guest house which is a 4 star guesthouse and includes free parking.
Actually, I'm looking for a hotel and in the same price range as the restaurant.
Can you please restate your hotel needs clearly? Thank you!
Yes I need a hotel in the same price range as the restaurant with free parking.
There are five hotels in the expensive price range. Do you have any other preferences?
Can you give me the first one and the star rating for it please? It has to have free parking.
express by holiday inn cambridge is rated 2 stars. Do you want me to make a booking there?
Does the Express by Holiday Inn have free parking?
Yes, the Express by Holiday Inn does have free parking. Do you want me to go ahead and make a booking for you?
Yes also I will need a taxi to get me between the hotel and the restaurant. I will need a contact number and car type with the booking.
First I need to know how many are in your party, what day you wish to check in, and how many nights you need a room.
I'd just like to book a taxi between the two. I'd like to get to the restaurant by my reservation time and I'll need the contact number and car type please.
Your reservation is for 12:15 with reference number NZ89K99X . And I have reserved a Grey Tesla to get you there. Contact number is 07635386509.
What time will the taxi arrive?
It will take about twenty minutes to get to the restaurant from the hotel. Say the taxi gets there at 11:30?
That will be fine.
