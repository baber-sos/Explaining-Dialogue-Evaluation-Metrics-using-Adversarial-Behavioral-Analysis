I am looking at a place to eat that serves venetian food in the centre.
Unfortunately, I don't see any restaurants that serve Venetian in the centre of town. Would you like to try a different area or type of cuisine?
Do you have any Chinese restaurants?
Yes there are 10 in the centre of town. Any price preference?
I was hoping for an expensive restaurant.
There are 4 expensive restaurants that are located in the town centre. The Ugly Duckling, Tang Chinese, HK Fusion, and Sesame Restaurant and bar, would you like information on one?
Can I book at the Ugly Duckling for 4 people, at 12:00 on wednesday please?
Great you're all set the reference number is 48MB42OD
Thank you! Can't wait!
