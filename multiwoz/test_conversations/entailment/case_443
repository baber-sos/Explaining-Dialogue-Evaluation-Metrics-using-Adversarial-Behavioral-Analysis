I'm looking for a train to London Kings Cross to arrive at 16:00. Can you help with that?
Yes, what is the day you will travel?
Saturday departing from Cambridge.
I see several trains. When would you like to leave?
I need a price and make sure it arrives by 16:00.
The TR6203 costs 18.88 and gets you in at 15:51. Does that sound good? I can book you a ticket if you like.
No need to book it for me. Are there any 3 star hotels in the moderate price range?
Could you please give me any preferences for internet/parking?
I would like it to be a guesthouse that has free wifi.
I have found 3 guesthouses that meet your requirements. Would you prefer to stay in the north, south or west area?
Do any/all of them have free parking as well?
Yes, all of them have free parking. Which part of the city would you like to stay?
Any, I'll take the first one on your list, and i'll need the address, and phone number please.
The bridge guest house is at 151 hills road and their number is 01223247942.
Awesome thank you. That is all I needed.
Thank you for using our service. Call us anytime. Take care. Goodbye.

TR4765 seems to be a better match for what you're looking for, it arrives by 18:10 and total travel time is 49 minutes. Would you like to book a ticket?
