I'd really like to get some Middle Eastern food. Can you find a cheap place for me to grab some dinner?
I see that there are none, maybe I should reconsider the cuisine. Thank you
Okay, thank you. goodbye
There is no middle east food in that area, another place or type perhaps?
Are there any that serve Italian food?
There are 5 Italian restaurant options available. Is there a particular area of town you prefer?
In the centre of town.
There are 3 available. Which do you prefer: Pizza Hut City Centre, Ask, or Zizzi Cambridge?
Book one for 8 people at 18:45 on wednesday.

I'm sure they do, would it be for the same amount of people? And how many days are you staying?
