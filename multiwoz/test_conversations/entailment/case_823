I would like to see some general information for king's college please.
King's College is a college and is located in the centre of town. There is no entrance fee.
Could you please send me the phone number?
Their phone number is 01223331100. Is there anything else I can do for you?
I am also looking for an expensive restaurant in the centre.
Sure, I can help you with that. Are you in the mood for a certain type of food?
Yes something creative and unusual.
I did not find any creative restaurants. Give me a moment and I will search for unusual ones.
Thank you.
Well, I hesitate to call it unusual, but perhaps you haven't had Turkish cuisine before? The Meze Bar Restaurant is delicious.
If you aren't able to find creative food, how about an indian one instead?
There are 6 indian restaurants located in the centre area. Would you like more information on one? I've heard the golden curry is good.
Please book Golden Curry for 2
What day and time would you like to book your reservation?
