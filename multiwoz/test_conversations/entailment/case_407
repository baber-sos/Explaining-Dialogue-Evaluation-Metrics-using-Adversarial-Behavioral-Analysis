I would like to go to an Indian restaurant in the north.
I found 2 that matches your criteria. Would you prefer a moderate or cheap pricing?
How about the moderate one? May I have their address, please?

Yes I have two guesthouses in the south. One in the moderate price range and another in the cheap price range. Do you have a preference?
