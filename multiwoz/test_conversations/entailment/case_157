I need to book a train for 9:30 that departs from cambridge.
There are lots of trains that fit those criteria. Where would you like to go?
I would like to go to London Liverpool Street on Wednesday.
There is a train that leaves at 7:59 and arrives at 9:27. Would like that one?
Yes, that would work. Can you book it for two people? Also, I need the reference number, please.
Booking was successful for TR2835, the total fee is 33.2 GBP payable at the station. Your reference number is : 3QZ8CPYE . Can I help with anything else?
Yes, please - I need a place to stay with free wifi and free parking.
The acorn guest house fits that criteria. It's located in the north region - would that work for you?
No, I'd actually prefer to stay on the west side. Do you have anything in the expensive price range? I'd also like free wifi and parking if possible.
The huntingdon marriott hotel is in the west and in the expensive price range. It also has the free parking and wifi. Can I book a room for you?
No, I don't need a room. I just need the postcode for that hotel, please.
