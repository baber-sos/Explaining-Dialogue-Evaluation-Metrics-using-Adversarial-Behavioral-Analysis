Can you find an attraction in the centre?
There are a lot, ranging from All Saints Church to The Cambridge Corn Exchange. Did you have something specific in mind?
Not really. I just want to see some local tourist attractions in the centre.
all saints church is in the center and it's known for it's architecture. The entrance fee is free.
I am also looking for a place to dine. The restaurant should serve turkish food and should be in the expensive price range
How about the Meze Bar Restaurant? It is located in the city centre.
Yes, that will work perfect. I will go ahead and contact them myself though. Thanks so much. Take care. Goodbye!
