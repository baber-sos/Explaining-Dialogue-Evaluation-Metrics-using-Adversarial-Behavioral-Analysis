Can you help me find a place to eat? I am looking for somewhere in the east with a moderate price.
There is the Curry Prince and Rajmahal restuarants serving Indian food. Then there is the Pizza Hut Fen Ditton serving Italian food. Which would you like more information on?
I think I'd like to try Rajmahal. Could you book me a table for 1 on Monday at 16:15?
Your reservation has been booked. Your reference number is Q9DRQ55J . Please be aware that your table will only be reserved until 16:30. Can i provide any more assistance?
I'm also looking for things to do in the same general area as the restaurant.
Sure, are you interested in museums, sports, parks, entertainment, swimming or boating?
Are there any cinemas? If there isn't what about something that has to do with multiple sports?
There aren't any cinemas in the general area, but what types of sports are you interested in?
All of them. What's there?
