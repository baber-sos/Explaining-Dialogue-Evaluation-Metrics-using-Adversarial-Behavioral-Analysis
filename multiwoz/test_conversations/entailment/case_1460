I'm trying to find a concert hall in the east part of town.
Unfortunately, I don't have any listings for concert halls on the east side. Can I check another area of town for you?

Sure. Cherry Hinton Hall and Grounds can be reached at 01223446104. It is on Cherry Hinton Road, postcode cb18dw. Can I help you with anything else today?
