There are many options that may suit your needs. Is there a particular day you are wanting to travel on?
Yes I want to leave on Tuesday.
What time would you like to leave on?
I don't care about departure time, but I need to arrive by 10:15
There is a train departing at 07:39 and arriving by 09:07 that fits your needs. Would you like me to book it for you?
