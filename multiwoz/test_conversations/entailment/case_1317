I need to find a place to eat in Centre.
There are many restaurants in centre. Did you have a specific price range or cuisine style you prefer?
moderate and British please.
Restaurant one seven looks good and is British in the moderate price range.
Great! Can I book a table for one at 13:45 on Thursday?
