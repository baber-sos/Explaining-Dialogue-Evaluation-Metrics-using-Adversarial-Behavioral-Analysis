Can you find a hotel named Worth House for me? Thanks.
Sure, it is a guesthouse in the north. Would you like me to book a room for you?
Can you tell me if they have free internet?
Yes, they have free wifi. Do you need anything else?
I would also like a train that leaves on Tuesday and arrive by 14:30.
There are many trains moving on Tuesday, can I get your preferred point of departure and arrival?
I will be going from Cambridge to Bishops Stortford.
There are multiple trains leaving that match your request. When is the earliest you would want to leave?
I need to arrive by 14:30 I don't have a preference on departing time.
TR2771 leaves at 13:29 and arrives at 14:07. Would this one work for you?
Yeah that works for me. Could you book that train for 6 people and then give me the reference number?
Booking was successful, the total fee is 60.59 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : 1GWWEV63 . Will there be anything else today?
