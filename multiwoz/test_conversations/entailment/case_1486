Can you help me find a place i am looking for? Its name is the Jesus Green outdoor pool.
Sure, the address is between Victoria Road and the River, the postcode is cb43px. Would you like their phone number for directions?
Great, thank you, and to be sure, this is actually a pool, correct?
Yes, it is listed as a swimming pool in the northern part of town. Is there anything else I can help you find today?
