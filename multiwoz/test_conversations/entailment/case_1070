I'm so bored, can you find me some kind of entertainment in the city centre please?
I'm sorry, there are no entertainment attractions in the centre of the city. Would you like to try a different area of the city?
What about a nightclub somewhere?
Sure, there are plenty of those in the centre. I'd recommend Kambar, located at 1 Wheeler Street. Can I get you more information?
Can I also get the phone number and entrance fee?
The phone number is 01223842725 and the entrance fee is 5 pounds. Can I help with anything else?
Great, thanks. Yes, actually. Can you find a train schedule for me? I'll be traveling Norwich to Cambridge on Thursday.
I have 19 trains between those two areas on Thursday. What time do you want to travel?
I need to leave after 19:30.
