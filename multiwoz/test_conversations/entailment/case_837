I need a train departing Cambridge arriving by 2030.
Which station are you traveling to, and on which day?
I need to go to Kings lynn on Wednesday and need to arrive before 20:30.
There are 5 trains. Would you like to leave at 5:11?
Sure. I'd like to book tickets for 6 people, and I'll need a reference number for the booking.
