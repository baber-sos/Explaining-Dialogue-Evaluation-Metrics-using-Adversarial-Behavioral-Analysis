Hello there! Could you help me find a hotel? I am looking for one that has free parking and is expensive.
Here is a list of hotels with free parking and are expensive.
I did not receive any list of hotels. Can you just pick one for me, a hotel with free parking and wifi that is upscale please.
We have the university arms hotel. It is located in centre and has wifi and parking. Would you like me to book that for you?
Yes, as long as it is expensive. I would like to arrive on Tuesday and stay for 3 nights. There will be 8 of us.
I'm sorry, but the hotel isn't available for you request. Would you like to try another day or shorter stay?
Can you try for 2 nights instead?
I would recommend the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel , which has what you need. Your booking reference number is FTTNX1M7 . Your two night stay will begin Tuesday. Thank you!
I am also interested in visiting a college in the centre of town. Could you help me with that?
Certainly. There are 13 colleges in the centre. Would you like more information?
Yes, please let me know the postcode and entrance fee of one in the centre area.
Christ's College is very famous, free to enter and their postcode is cb23bu. Will there be anything else?
I will need a taxi to travel between the hotel and the college. Can you handle this also?
Yes, I can. Can you please give me the time you'd like to leave or arrive by?
I would like to leave the college by 24:30 and can I also have the contact number and car type.
All right. I've booked you a black volkswagen, picking you up at 24:30 at Christ's College. The contact number is 07324891478. Is there anything else I can help with?
No, that's all. Thanks.
