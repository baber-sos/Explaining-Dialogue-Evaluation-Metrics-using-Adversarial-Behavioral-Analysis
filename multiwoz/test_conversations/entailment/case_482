Hi, I'm looking for a hotel to stay in that includes free wifi. I'm looking to stay in a hotel, not a guesthouse.
Yes I have many options. What is your preferred price point?
I would like one in the moderate price range and with free parking.
I would recommend the Lovell Lodge. It is indeed a hotel despite it's name and is very cute.
Okay, please book that for 3 people and 2 nights starting from Friday.
Booking was successful. Reference number is : 9HMD04UW . anything else?
I would love to find a restaurant in the same price range as the Lovell Lodge.
In what area?
I would like the west please.
I'd recommend prezzo, its an italian restaurant on 21 - 24 Northampton Road. Would you like a table?
I'm sorry. I actually need a restaurant in the centre.
We have more than 20 moderately priced restaurants in the centre of town. Do you have a preference for cuisine?
I would like chinese. I would like that for 7pm.
We have three moderate Chinese restaurants in the centre. May I suggest the Lan Hong House?
