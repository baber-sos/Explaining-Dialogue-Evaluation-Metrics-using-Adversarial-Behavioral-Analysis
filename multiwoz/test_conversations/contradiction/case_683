I am planning a trip in Cambridge
Great! I can help you with any tourist information you may need.
I am sorry, I meant a trip into Kings Lynn. I am coming from Cambridge and looking for a train.
Ok, just tell me what day and time and I will be able to tell you what is available.
I'm leaving on Tuesday. I'd like to leave after 19:45.
