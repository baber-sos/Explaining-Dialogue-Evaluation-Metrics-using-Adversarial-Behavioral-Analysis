Yeah, I'm looking for an entertaining tourist attraction, can point me in the direction of some places to check out?
I have about 5 different entertainment venues if that is what you are looking for. Do you have a preference on the area its located in?
No preference, please just pick one and give me the postcode and address.
I think you'd enjoy the Funky Fun House. They're located at 8 mercers row, mercers row industrial estate. Their postcode is cb58hy. Can I help you with anything else?
