i need a place to stay
Is there a certain area or price range you had in mind?
I really want to stay with something moderately priced. But, I want it to be 4 star rated if possible.
There are lots of moderately priced four star hotels. Are you interested in a particular part of town?
Maybe a guesthouse with free parking, I have 7 guests and that will be for 2 nights this Monday
