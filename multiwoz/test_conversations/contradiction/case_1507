I'm interesting in info about 3-star hotels and such that offer free wifi.
I have two hotels that match the description of 3 star ratings. Are you looking for a hotel in the centre or south area?
the location doesn't matter so long as it has free wifi
The Gonville Hotel is supposed to be great and it offers free wifi. Would you like me to book you a room?
