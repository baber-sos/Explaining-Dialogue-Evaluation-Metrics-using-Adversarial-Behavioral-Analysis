I can help you with that. The first one departs at 05:00 and the last trains runs at 13:00. How many tickets would you like?
Also the destination is london kings cross and leaves after 12:30.
There is a train leaving at 13:00 that fits your criteria. Would you like me to book it for you?
Yes, please, just one ticket.
Great! Your booking was successful. The fee will be 23.6 GBP payable at the station. Would you like the reference number?
Yes, please. I am also looking for attractions in the East part of town.
Your reference number is D1PGC203 . There are several attractions in the east. May I suggest the Camboats boat?
