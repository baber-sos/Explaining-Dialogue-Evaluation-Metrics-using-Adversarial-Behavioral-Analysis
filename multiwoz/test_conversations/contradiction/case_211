My friends and I are into the club scene, what nightclubs are in Cambridge?
There are five nightclubs in the centre of town and one nightclub on the south side. Do you have a preference on location?
You can chose for me but I need a entrance fee.
In the centre, 4 of the nightclubs have a fee of 5 pounds and one has an entrance fee of 4 pounds. What else can I help you with?
I am also looking for a train to go between Ely and Cambridge.
