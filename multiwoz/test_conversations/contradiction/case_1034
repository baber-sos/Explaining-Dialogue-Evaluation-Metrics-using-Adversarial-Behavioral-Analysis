I am looking for information in Cambridge
I can help book a hotel if you need it!
I'm actually looking for a train. I'm leaving from Cambridge on Friday.
I will be happy to help with that! Where are you travelling to?
I need to travel to ely.
We have 10 trains going to Ely on Friday. Do you have a time you want to arrive or leave by?
I'd like to arrive by 18:00. Any that do that will be fine. I'll need a train ID, departure time, and travel time, please?
The TR5844 departs at 15:50 and has a travel time of 17 minutes. Would you like me to book it for you?
Yes, 5 tickets. I also need a hotel in the north, free parking is not necessary.
Booking was successful, the total fee is 22 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : 8NJO8Q4C .
I am also looking for a place to stay in the north, no guesthouses, just hotels please.
I can help you with that. What price range are you looking at?
I don't care about the price and it doesn't need to have free parking.
May i suggest the Lovell Lodge. It's a moderate priced 2 star hotel in the north part of town with free parking and internet.
Sure, can you book it?
I sure can! Would you like to book rooms for 5 people?
Yes can you please get that booked for me.
When will you be arriving and how many nights will you be staying?
I am arriving on Friday.
how many days will you stay?
Sorry I do not need to make a reservation but I do need the postcode, phone number, and whether they have internet.
Their postcode is cb41sr and phone number is 01223425478. They offer free parking and internet. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Thank you, thats all I need today
