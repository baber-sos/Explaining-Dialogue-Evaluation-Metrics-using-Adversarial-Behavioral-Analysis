Could you help me find a boat to visit on the north side?
I have one in that area. It's called the Riverboat Georgina. It's located at Cambridge Passenger Cruisers, Jubilee House. Would you like their phone number for more information?
Yes, I want the phone number and also the entrance fee, please.
Their phone number is 01223902091 and we do not have the entrance fee in our database at this time.
Okay, that is all I need today. Thank you very much.
