I'm looking for a train that leaves on Saturday and arrives by 10.30
Where are you traveling to and from?
I am going to cambridge from birmingham new street.
There are 5 trains available, may I book one for you that leaves at 7:40 and arrives at 10:23?
What is the train ID?
The train ID is TR8259.
Yes, that train sounds good. Please book it for me. Could you also find me a hotel with a moderate price that offers internet?
Before we start on the hotel, did you need tickets for the train?
No thank you, I was just pre-planning a route.
There are 17 hotels listed. What part of town would you like to stay in?
The north part of town please, preferably in a guesthouse.
Cambridge has 8 moderately priced guesthouses in the north. I would suggest Acorn Guest House, with a star rating of 4. Would you like me to book it?
Yes please, I would like to book it for 7 people for 5 nights on Saturday, and I need a reference number.
