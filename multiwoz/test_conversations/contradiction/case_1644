Hello, I would like to book a train, leaving Cambridge and going to Stansted Airport.
Ok, when would you like to leave and what time would you like to leave at?
I just want to arrive in stansted airport on tuesday before 11:00.
TR1951 leaves Cambridge at 06:40 and arrives at the airport at 07:08. Would that work?
It's a little early in the morning, but it will do, I'll just set my alarm extra loud. Departure time is 06:40?
Sounds great, I can go ahead and book that. How many tickets will you be needing?
I will get tickets at the train station, early trains usually aren't that full. Can you find me a hotel though?
Of course, what are your specifications?
I am looking for a moderately-priced hotel in the north part of town.
I have 2 hotels the ashley hotel or the lovell lodge. Do you have a preference?
I need to book in of those that has free wifi and free parking. I will to book fro 5 people for two nights starting on Sunday. I need the reference number.
