I would like to find in Cambridge, a restaurant, located in the Centre area. I love spanish food.
I have La Tasca downtown here at 14 - 16 Bridge street.
The restaurant should be in the expensive price range
I do not have any in the centre, another criteria perhaps?
How about african food?
I was able to find bedouin, would you like to try that?
That would be great, could you just give me their number?
The number is 01223367660. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I also want to find an expensive place to stay with a star rating of 3 please.
With that criteria, I have two different options for you. Both are hotels and offer free parking and wifi. One is in the centre of town and one is south.
I want one that is in the same area as Bedouin, please.
The gonville hotel is in the centre which is the same area as Bedouin. Would you like me to book it for you?
Yes, please book that for 8 people starting Friday for 3 nights.
I am sorry that is not available. Would you like to try another day or a shorter stay perhaps?
Yes, please try again for only 2 nights and see if that works.
All set for 2 nights at the Gonville. Your reference number is 1KWO1IPE .
Thank you, that's all I need today!
