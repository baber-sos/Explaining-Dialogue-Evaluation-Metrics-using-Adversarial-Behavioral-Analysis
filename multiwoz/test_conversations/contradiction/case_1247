Could you tell me if there are any corsica restaurants in the south side?
There aren't any corsica restaurants located in the south side.
That's fine, how about Chinese in the same area?
Yes, there are three Chinese restaurants in the South. Would you prefer cheap or expensive?
I am not bothered about the price. Why don't you select one and provide me with their telephone number and price range?
the good luck chinese food takeaway is expensive and the postcode is cb17ag
What is its phone number
Their phone number is 01223244149. Would like to book a table?
Yes can you please?
Yes, I can. How many people will be with you, on what day and at what time would you like your reservation?
Actually, that is all the information I need. I do need a place to stay in the same area.
There are 3 guesthouses and 1 hotel in the south. Do you have a certain price range you are looking for?
I would like a 3 star expensive place please.
