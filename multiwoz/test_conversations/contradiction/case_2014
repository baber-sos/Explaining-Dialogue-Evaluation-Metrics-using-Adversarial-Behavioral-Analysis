Hello, I'm looking for places to go in the centre.
There are many attractions in the centre like museums, architecture, boating, and concerthalls. What are you interested in?
How about a boating attraction?
There are two in the centre of town. Scudamores Punting Co, and the Cambridge Punter. Would either of those interest you?
Could you give me the address for the Cambridge Punter, please? I also need a place to stay, preferably somewhere cheap.
Sure, the cambridge punter is lcoated at 251a chesterton road. The autumn house is in the cheap price range with 4 stars. Would you like to book a room?
