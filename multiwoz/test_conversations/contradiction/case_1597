I am looking for a place to stay in Cambridge. I prefer it to be in the north and include free wifi, please.
Do you have any other specifications?
Yes, if you could find a 4 star hotel with free parking that would be great.
Sorry there are no 4 star hotel fitting that description. Anything else?
Can you list alternatives close to 4 star with free parking?
What type of alternatives would you like to know about?
I need some place in the north, four stars and having free wifi.
There are seven guesthouses in the North that offer parking and internet, I am not sure if the parking and internet are free though.
I really need one that has free parking. Can you check again please?
Parking is free on all 7, do you have a preference?
No preference really. Could you pick one and get me the postcode and price range please?
I have selected the kirkwood house, it is moderately priced and the postal code is cb41da, can I help with anything else?
I also need a train going to kings lynn on Wednesday.
TR5159 leaves for kings lynn from cambridge leaves at 05.11
OK, thank you, I just need the price.
Sure, TR5159 from Cambridge to Kings Lynn costs 9.80 pounds. Is there anything else I can help with?
