Hi, can you find me a train going to birmingham new street that leaves after 16:45?
What day would you like to go and where will you be departing from?
I would like to leave cambridge on Wednesday.
There a few trains that will get you there. TR1766 departs at 18:01 and arrives at 20:44. Does that work for you?
Yes that works. Please book it for 6 people.
I booked your seats for 6 people on TR1766 departing Cambridge on Wednesday at 19:01. The total comes to 450.6GBP and your reference number is 8WMYBHC3 .
Great! Now I am looking for a hotel called Finches bed and breakfast.
