i need a place to go and should be a museum
Okay! There are several museums in Cambridge. What part of town would you like to visit?
How about ones in the centre, what's available?
There's 11 different museums in the centre. Would you like a recommendation?
Yes, and if you can tell me it's entrance fee, that'd be great.
The entrance fee is free. is there anything else
Could you give me the name of the museum?
My favorite free museum is the Broughton House Gallery at 98 King Street.
Can I have the info of this place thank you
What would you like to know?
Oh thank you for the name of the museum and what part of the area is this museum in? I'd also like information about the Lensfield Hotel.
The museum is in the center part of time. The lensfield hotel is in the south, it's expensive, three stars and has free wifi and parking.
