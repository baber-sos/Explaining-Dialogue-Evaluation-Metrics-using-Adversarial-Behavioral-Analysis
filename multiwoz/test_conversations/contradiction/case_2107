Are there any Italian restaurants in the city centre?
There are quite a few Italian restaurants in the centre. Would you like something cheap, moderately priced, or more expensive?
I would like something in the cheap range and i need the address and phone number
Sure, how about Pizza Hut City Centre? It's at Regent Street City Centre cb21ab and can be reached at 01223323737. May I help with anything else?
Yes, please. I would like information about the Ashley Hotel.
The Ashley Hotel is in the north part of town. It is a moderately priced two star hotel with internet service and parking. Would you like to make a reservation?
