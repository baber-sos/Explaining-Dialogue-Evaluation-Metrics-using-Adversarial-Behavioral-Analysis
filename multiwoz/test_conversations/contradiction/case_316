Hi, I'll be coming in to Cambridge and I'd like a place to stay. I'd like a guesthouse with free parking.
I've got 33 guesthouses that offer free parking, do you have any more preferences?
I'd like it to be in the east, if possible.
There are five guesthouses that offer free parking. 3 are cheap and 2 are moderate. Which pricerange do you prefer?
I'll take a cheap one please.
I found allenbell to meet your needs. Would you like me to book that for you?
No that would be all.
Let me give you their phone number which is 01223210353. Allenbell's address is 517a coldham lane, cb13js. Is there anything else I can help you with?
