I'm looking for a moderately priced place to eat that's in the centre of town.
What type of cuisine are you looking for? There are 21 restaurants in that area.
I don't have a preference.
Out of the 21 restaurant choices, one is the Yippee Noodle Bar which is moderately priced in the centre of town. Would you like to make a reservation?
That sounds great, what is the postcode?
Their postcode is cb11lh and if you want a reservation just let me know the time, party size, and day and I'll make it for you.
Not now, thanks. Here's a weird one, though - are there any expensive 0-star hotels in the center of town?
I'm sorry, but there are no expensive 0-star hotels in the area. Can I help you find something else?
