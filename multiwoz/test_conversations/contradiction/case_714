Hello, can you help me find a train to Broxbourne on Thursday please?
What time would you like to travel?
I need to be in Broxbourne by 08:00.
no trains arrives by that time but have one that arrives by 07:01
If it leaves Cambridge and gets to Broxbourne at 7:01 I'll take it. I need a ticket for 1 person and a reference number please.
Booking was successful, the total fee is 17.89 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is : 2EDVUNPK . Can I help you with anything else today?
I'm looking for boat related attractions in the west.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid there's nothing like that in the west. There are a few options in other parts of town. Would you like to hear about them?
