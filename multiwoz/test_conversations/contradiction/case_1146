I need to get train ticket leaving cambridge after 14:45 please.
Ok I have a total of 1,365 entries that leave after that time. Do you have a specific day or destination you would like to select ?
I need to go to Birmingham new street on Monday.
I would recommend train ID TR5435 which leaves Cambridge at 15:02 and arrives at Birmingham New Street at 17:44.
What is the exact travel time on the TR5435?
The total travel time will be 163 minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
I could use some help finding a restaurant that is moderately priced.
We have many options that are moderately priced. Is there a specific area or type of cuisine you are looking for?
I don't care about the cuisine but I want it to be in the west.
We have prezzo. It is an italian restaurant located in the west. It is moderately priced. Would you like me to book it for you?
That won't be necessary. What is the postcode?
prezzo's postcode is cb30ad.
