i need a place to stay
Let's find you a great place in the city. Do you have a preference on what area in town?
I don't. I will need a guesthouse with at least 4 star. It should also have free wifi.
There are 18 entries that match your request. To help narrow results down, do you have a pricerange?
No, just choose one please. I'll need to book it for Saturday, 3 nights, and 6 people.
I have booked you at the Acorn Guesthouse. Reference number VTGT4PFZ . Can I be of any further help?
Thank you. The next thing I need is a train from Cambridge to stevenage.
What day will you be traveling?
I will be traveling on and need to leave after 18:45.
Okay, can you please tell me the day?
sunday please ?
Train TR8726 meets your criteria. Would you like me to book it for you?
Yes, please. There are six of us who need on it.
