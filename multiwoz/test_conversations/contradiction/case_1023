I'm looking for a museum to go to and it should be in the centre. I would like free admission.
I have 11 different options to choose from. If you would like a recommendation, the Primavera is a great museum to visit! Would you like more information on them?
I am looking for a museum in the city center.
Castle galleries is a great place to visit in town centre and also has free entrance. Would you like the address?
Yes,and I will be needing the phone number also.
Castle galleries is located at unit su43, grande arcade, saint andrews street, phone 01223307402. Can I help you with anything else today?
Yes, I was also interested in a European restaurant in the same area.
We have 6 european restaurants in the centre area. Do you have a price preference?
I need a moderate price range.
Hotel du vin and bistro or galleria should meet your needs. Would you like to book a table? If you'd prefer modern european instead, I can make a different recommendation.
Galleria sounds good. Can you make a reservation for Monday for 3 at 12:30?
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : G9LKUWQJ . Can I help with anything else today?
