I was wondering if you could help me find a hotel in the south part of town.
I sure can. We have four accommodation options in the south part of town. One is a hotel, and three are guesthouses. Do you have a preference?
The hotel should be in the cheap price range and should have a star of 4 with free wifi.
Great, I've found one that fits just that. How about Rosa's Bed and Breakfast?
Is that a hotel or a guesthouse?
Rosa's bed and breakfast is a guesthouse. Can I book this for you?
Actually first I would like you to help me find a train that goes between Peterborough and Cambridge on Saturday.
There are 38 possible entries for a train between Peterborough abs Cambridge. Did you have a departure time you would like?
I'd like to arrive by 20:45 if possible.
I have several that get to Cambridge before 20:45, any time you'd like to leave?
I am not looking to make a booking, I just want to know what the travel time is.
The travel time from peterborough to cambridge is 50 minutes, for all 38 trips.
That is all I need. Thank you.
You're welcome. Thanks for contacting the Cambridge TownInfo centre and have a great day.
