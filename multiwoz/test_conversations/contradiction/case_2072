I'm looking for a place to stay in Cambridge, please.
There are 33 places to stay in Cambridge. Do you have a preferred area of Cambridge?
The location isn't really important. It does need to be cheap though, and preferably a guesthouse.
I have nine places. Do you need free parking or any other restrictions?
I need internet in the west.
There is one available would you like me to book it?
what is the name of the place?
The name is Finches Bed and Breakfast. Would you like to book a room there?
Yes can you please?
How many people in the room and how many nights would you like to stay?
I'm sorry, I am mistaken. I will not need you to book a reservation for me. I will need the area, address, and post code please.
finches bed and breakfast is a guesthouse in the west. It's cheap, and four stars. 144 thornton road, cb30nd. Phone is 01223276653. Can i help with anything else?
I'm also looking for a cheap Italian place in the center of town.
