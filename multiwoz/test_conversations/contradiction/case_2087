I would a train. I'm going from birmingham new street and it needs to arrive by 11:00.
What day would you like to travel?
I am leaving on Saturday, and the train should go to cambridge.
TR8259 will arrive in Cambridge at 10:23. Would you like me to book a ticket for you on that train?
Not yet. First I would like to get price and departure time.
It will depart at 7:40 and it will cost 60.08 pounds. Do you need help with anything else?
and i need a place to stay
Okay there are many options. Do you have a price preference or area?
I would like something in the east. I also prefer a guesthouse.
There is a and B Guesthouse, it is in the East part of town
That sounds good, I have 7 people in total.
Could you tell me the dates, and how many rooms you will be needing?
It will be for Saturday and for 3 nights.
Okay, three nights. Would you like me to book that?
Yes, of course I want you to book it. And give me the reference number too!
Unfortunately I am having trouble with booking that for you. Is there other options we could explore.
Hmmm, could you try again. That is what I really need.
Unfortunately it isn't allowing me to make that reservation. I am sorry, is there anything else I can do for you?
