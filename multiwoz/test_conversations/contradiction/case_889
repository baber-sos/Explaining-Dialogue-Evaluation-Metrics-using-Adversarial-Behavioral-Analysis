I am looking for a moderately priced place to dine in the centre of Cambridge
Is there any specific type of food you are wanting?
I would like a polynesian restaurant, please.
Unfortunately there are no Polynesian restaurants located in Cambridge, were you wanting any other type of food?
Are there any Turkish restaurants?
