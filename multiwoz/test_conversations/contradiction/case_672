Hello. I'm going out for an expensive dinner and need to find a restaurant. I'd like somewhere in the north, and I'm willing to pay quite a bit of money.
I'd be happy to help you with that. I have 5 expensive restaurants in the north. Did you have a type of cuisine in mind?
Yes, Romanian please.
There are no options for romanian, can I try something else for you?
I guess try European.
The city stop restaurant is a european restaurant in the expensive price range.
Is it in the north? If so, can you reserve us a table for 3 on Friday at 17:45 please?
I am sorry but the restaurant will be unable to reserve a table for that time. Would you like to try another day or time?
How about at 16:45?
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. The reference number is: 0PK0TW8F
I'm also looking for a place to stay that offers both internet and free parking.
There are 29 places in Cambridge which offer both, any other preferences?
Hmm, yes. Someplace expensive.
I can recommend the University Arms hotel in the centre of the city.
Great, can you make a reservation for three people for the three nights starting Friday please?
I'm sorry, I couldn't book that for you, would you like to try another day?
No, I need it to be Friday. Can we try it for a one night stay instead?
