Hello. I'm looking for a moderately priced four star hotel in Cambridge. Can you make some recommendations?
There are 11 4-star hotels within your price range. Do you need internet and/or parking?
I need internet but not interested in parking
The acorn guest house may be a great option.
If there are no hotels, a guesthouse would be fine, I suppose.
Could you like me to book that for you?
Yes please, I need to book for 5 nights starting saturday for one person. Could you please provide me with a reference number after booking?
I reserved a room for you at the acorn guest house for Saturday. Your reference is GU5QPFQR . Please let me know if I can be of further assistance
Thanks. I also want to visit a museum.
What area would you like me to look in?
