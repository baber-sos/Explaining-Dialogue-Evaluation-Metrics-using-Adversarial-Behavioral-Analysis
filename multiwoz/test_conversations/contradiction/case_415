I need to find a hotel that has free parking.
Sure I can help with that. What area will you be staying in?
In the centre, I more specifically am looking for a guesthouse with a 0 star rating in that area.
El Shaddai is a 0 star guesthouse located in the centre has both free parking and wifi. What days are you interested in staying there? can I book for you?
Yes please. book it for 5 people and 3 nights starting from tuesday
Okay, will you be needing a reference number?
Yes, please for my records
I have your reservation for 5 people, 3 nights starting on tuesday. your reference number is X3MDWDWY, can I help with anything else?
Yes, I am interested in places to go while I am in town. Perhaps a museum in the same area as the hotel.
I have about 11 different museums. If I may, might I suggest the Scott Polar Museum on Lensfield Road. They also have free entrance. It's a great place to visit.
Sure, what is the address for this museum? Thanks for your help!
The museum is on lensfield road post code cb21er and it's number is 01223336540.
Would it be possible to book a taxi to get from the hotel to the museum? We would like to leave the hotel at 6:00.
I have your taxi booked. What else can I do?
Well, do I look for a specific make and color car or just jump into a random one? Does the driver have a phone number?
you have been assigned a specific car.
well what is it? This is ridiculous! Your very rude
I apologize. I did not mean to come off as rude. You should expect a white Volvo. If you need to reach the company, please call 07499481174.
