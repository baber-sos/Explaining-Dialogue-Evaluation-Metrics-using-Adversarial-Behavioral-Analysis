Find me a museum, please.
There are 23 museums. Do you have an area as a preference?
I just need the area and address for one of them.
I have the broughton house gallery in the centre at 98 king street
Thank you so much. I also need a place to dine in the centre that serves Chinese food.
I have 10 place in the centre. Did you have a price range you were looking at?
I would like the cheap price range.
I recommend the rice house. Would you like me to reserve a table?
Yes, please book me a table for 8 on Monday at 19:30.
Unfortunately, I could not book the rice house for that day and time. Is there another day or time that would work for you?
Can you try a half hour earlier or later and see if they have anything available?
No luck, would you like me to try something else?
Yes, please find another cheap restaurant for that amount of people at that time.
I was unable to book any cheap chinese restaurants, do you have another preference for time?
I am really needing to find a cheap restaurant that serves chinese food that is located in the centre. Would you mind double checking?
I have the charlie chan. It is a chinese restaurant in the centre that is cheap. Would you like me to make you a booking?
Sure for 8 people at 19:30 on Monday please.
