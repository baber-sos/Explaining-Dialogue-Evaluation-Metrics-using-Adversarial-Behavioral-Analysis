I'm trying to find someplace to visit in town.
I can help you with that! Do you have a specific type of attraction in mind, or perhaps a certain area?
Yes, I need an attraction in the weat
There are a lot of colleges and museums in the west, do either of those work?
Yes. Can you recommend one place and provide their phone number and postcode?
Certainly. Churchill College: postcode cb30ds, phone number 01223332360.
Im also looking for a 4 star hotel.
There are 21 4 star hotels. What area would you like to stay?
Are any of those in the moderate price range?
No they are not.
how about one that is in the expensive price range.
The Huntingdon Marriott Hotel is the only expensive option in the West. Would you like me to book it for you?
