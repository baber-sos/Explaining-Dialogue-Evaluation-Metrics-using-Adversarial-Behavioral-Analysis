I want to find a moderately priced restaurant that has Spanish food.
La tasca is the only matching restaurant. It is in the center of town.
I would like to book at La tasca please.
Ok. When and for how many people?
I want to book a table for 2 people at 16:30 on wednesday.
I've booked your table for two for Wednesday at 16:30. Your Reference number is : NXLK0Z1U . Can I assist you with anything else today?
Yes, I'll need a train on the same day, departing from london kings cross.
I found 10 trains do you have a destination or time you would like to go?
Yes, I am travelling to cambridge and need to arrive there by 8:15.
If you want to leave very early, there is a 5:17 train arriving at 6:08. Your other option is the 7:17, arriving at 8:08.
Can I have the train ID and price of the 7:17 departure?
The train ID is 407. Adult tickets are $7.50 each way.
Hmm, that train ID and price don't look right to me. Could you double-check that?
I apologize for my error. The trainID is TR4543 and the price is 23.60. Would you like me to book that for you?
I just need the departure time confirmed and that's all, I shouldn't need it booked.
TR4543 leaves london kings cross at 07:17 arriving in cambridge 08:08.
