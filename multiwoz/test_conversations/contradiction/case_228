I would like some South African food that is not too expensive.
Unfortunately there are no restaurants available that fit that criteria. Is there another type of cuisine you might be interested in eating?
Are there any African restaurants outside of the city center?
The only listing we have is for Bedouin in the city centre. Would you like to try a different type of cuisine?
Yeah, how about a gastropub then?
Yes I have several in the city center. What price range are you ideally looking for?
Moderate. Please give me a phone number, address, and postcode for the restaurant you find. Thanks!
I have the cow pizza kitchen and bar located at corn exchange street cb23qf, phone number 01223308871.
Cow Pizza Kitchen? That is great. lol. Can you help me find a certain attraction now? I believe it's called Gallery at Twelve.
Yes I have located The Gallery at Twelve. The address is listed as fulbourn and their telephone number is: 01223295264.
What kind of attraction is Gallery at twelve? Can you also tell me what their entrance fee and postcode are?
The Gallery At Twelve A High Street is a museum. Entry is free, and their postcode is cb15dh.
OK great. I will need to book a taxi between the Cow Pizza Kitchen and The Gallery at Twelve. Can you help me?
Sure what time would you like to be picked up?
I would like to leave The Gallery at Twelve by 19:30.
Alright, I've booked you a blue volvo, the contact number is 07600966751.
Can I get the phone number for the taxi company and the type of car I will be picked up in?
Yes, you will have a Blue Volvo and you can contact the taxi company at 07600966751. Can I help with anything else today?
