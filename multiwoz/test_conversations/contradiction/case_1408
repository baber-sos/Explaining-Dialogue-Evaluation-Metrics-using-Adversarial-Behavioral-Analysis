Hello there, I am traveling to Cambridge soon and I am looking for a play to stay in the north side of town.
There are 13 places to stay. Do you have any other requirements outside of the north area?
Yes, i need a 4 star hotel that also includes free wifi.
How about the acorn guest house at 154 chesterton road?
That sounds good. Do they have free parking?
Yes, they have free parking as well. Would you like me to book it for you?
Great, can I get their phone number please? And I also wanted to see if you have any info on the Mumford Theatre.
Yes, the phone number there is 01223353888. What sort of information would you like on Mumford Theatre?
I need to know where they are located and if they have an entrance fee please.
It is located at anglia ruskin enterprise, east road and I'm not sure if there are any fees. You will need to call them.
