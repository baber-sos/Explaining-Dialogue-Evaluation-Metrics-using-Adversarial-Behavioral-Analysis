Find me an expensive modern global restaurant to dine in.
I have no restaurants matching what you asked. Would you like a different price range?
Are you sure there are none in the center of town?
Yes. In fact, we don't have a modern global restaurant anywhere in Cambridge. Do you need help with anything else?
How about one that serves european food in the centre?
I have 8 restaurants that serve European food in the centre. Do you have a specific price range that you are looking at?
I'd like expensive european food. Pick one and give me a phone number please.
I recommend Michaelhouse. Their phone number is 01223309147. Is there anything else you need help with?
Yes, I need help finding a train. I'd like to find one from ely on saturday.
There are several trains departing from ely on Saturday. What time would you like to leave?
I would like to get there by 09:00 and I am going to Cambridge
TR2551 leaves Ely at 07:35 and arrives in Cambridge at 07:52. Would you like me to book a ticket for you?
