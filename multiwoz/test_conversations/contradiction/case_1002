I need to find a restaurant in the centre.
Do you prefer a particular type of food or are you looking at a specific price range?
I would like British food. I have no preference of price range.
There are 7 restaurants which meet your needs. The Copper Kettle is located at 4 Kings Parade and serves moderate priced meals. would you like to make reservations?
Yes I need a table for 6 Monday at 18:15.
Your table for 6 is reserved for Monday at 18:15 and they'll hold your table for 15 minutes. Your reference number is T67ZV5US . Can I help you with anything else today?
I am also looking for an attraction, some type of boat.
I have 4 listings. One in the east, north or 2 in the centre. Would you like more information on one of them?
Sure, the one in the east please.
I have the camboats located at the plough, green end, fen ditton.
Could you tell me what the postcode is for the camboats?
The postcode is cb58sx. Would you like the phone number?
no, what the address and area of town, also I will be needing a cab as well.
