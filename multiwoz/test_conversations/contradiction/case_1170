I am looking to book a hotel in the Cambridge area.
There are 33 hotels to choose from. Would you like to narrow your search by area or price range?
I am looking for Cityroomz. I'd like to book rooms for 7 people who will be staying for 4 nights from Sunday. Please respond with a reference number
Booking was successful. Your reference number is : 1ULIHMUA . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Yes, I am looking for a restaurant in the west that serves indian food.
There are 6 restaurants in the west that serve Indian food. What price range would you prefer? Expensive or Moderate?
The restaurant should be in the expensive price range.
I have 5 different options, "tandoori palace" "rice boat" "cocum" "india house" and "maharajah tandoori restaurant". Did any of those interest you?
Tandoori palace has a catchy name. Could you book me a table there for the same group of people on the same day at 17:15?
Booking was successful. Your reference number is : S7FEI7MS . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
