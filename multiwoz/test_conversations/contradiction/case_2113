I'm looking for a nice place to eat.
There are many fine places to eat. What type of cuisine would you prefer?
I don't care about the cuisine type, but I want it to be somewhere expensive and in the centre please.
There are a number of expensive eateries in the centre. How about one of my favorites - Midsummer House Restaurant? They serve British food and it's delicious!
Okay. Can you book me a table for 3 people for 16:15 on a Thursday? I will need the reference number.
I have made those reservations your reference number is PLGQUXC8 .
Great, can't wait. I am also looking for some places to go in the same area as the restaurant.
I have more than 40 attractions in the centre of town. What type of attraction did you have in mind?
What would you recommend?
Personally, I would go to a museum, but there are plenty of other types of attractions from nightclubs to colleges as well.
Okay, well, what's a good museum to try?
I suggest the Castle Galleries. It's free and in the centre of town. Do you want an address?
