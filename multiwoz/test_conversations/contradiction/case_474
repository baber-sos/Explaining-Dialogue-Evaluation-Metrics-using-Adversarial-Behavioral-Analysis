I am in ely. I need to figure out how to get to cambridge by train.
What day would you like to travel?
I need to travel monday and arrive by 20:45
There are 8 trains that arrive before this time. The TR6679 arrives at 19:52, which is the closest to your requested time. Does that work for you?
Yes, that works for me. Please go ahead and book it. Thank you!
I'd be happy to book that for you, how many tickets do you need?
Just one ticket, I'm also looking for an attraction in the Centre.
Alright, train booked for you, your reference number is SM4XH1CM . Did you have a particular type of attraction in the centre you are interested in?
I'm looking for a college, actually.
I have 18 results for colleges. To help narrow it down, are you looking for one in a particular area? Some are free and some have entrance fees.
Let's look at ones that have no entrance fee please.
Christ's College is in the centre and is free. Would that work for you?
Yes that sounds good. What is their phone number and postcode?
The phone number is 01223334900. The postcode is cb23bu.
Thank you, what time did the train depart?
TR6679 leaves Cambridge at 19:35 on Monday. Is that still going to work for you?
