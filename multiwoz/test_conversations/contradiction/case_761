Hi, I'm looking for a place to eat some indian food.
Do you have a price range in mind?
I would like it to be expensive.
I have several great options. Did you have an area of town in mind?
I'd like a place in the south, please.
taj tandoori is the place you want to go. It meets all of your needs. Need a table?
No, but can you give me the address, postcode, and phone number?
Of course, the address is 64 Cherry Hinton Road Cherry Hinton and their postcode is cb17aa. Their phone number is 01223412299
I would also like to go to some attractions in the same area as the restaurant.
There are a number of attractions in the area. There's a cinema, a museum, a nightclub, some parks, a theatre... Do any of these appeal to you in particular?
restaurant is what i am looking for, entrance fee and postcode please. get me a taxi from the attraction by 10.15, get me its contact number and car type.
Just to clarify you are looking for another restaurant and not an attraction?
Oh, yeah, I do want information on attractions! In the same area. After that, I will need a taxi.
If you like parks the Wandlbury Country Park has free admission and is in the cb223ae postcode. Or I can tell you about the other attractions?
That sounds wonderful, is it also in the South part of town? If so, I'd like a taxi from there to my hotel.
Yes, Wandlebury Country Park is in the south. In order to help you book a taxi between the park and your hotel, I need to know what hotel you're at.
I want a taxi from the restaurant that I am at
Ok, so you'd like a taxi from the restaurant to the park? Could you please let me know your desired departure and arrival times?
I'm sorry, I'd like a taxi from Wandlebury Country Park to Taj Tandoori. I'd like the taxi to pick me up at 10:15.
