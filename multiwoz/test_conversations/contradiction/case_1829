I'm looking for a place to eat. Something moderately priced, in the center.
Yes, there are lots of options for you. What type of food are you looking for?
I don't really have a type of cuisine in mind. Maybe you could recommend someplace moderately priced and in the centre of town?
I can recommend the yippee noodle bar it is asian oriental. Does that sound ok?
Sounds great, can you book it or 2 people at 15:30 om Monday?
Booking was successful. The table will be reserved for 15 minutes. Reference number is : UGF14FPI . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
I am looking for some places to go in the same area as the restaurant.
You are in luck. The center has colleges, architecture, boats, museums, concert hall, nightclubs, park, swimming pool, and theatres. Which one appeals to you?
Please select your favorite and then give me the phone number and entrance fee information
