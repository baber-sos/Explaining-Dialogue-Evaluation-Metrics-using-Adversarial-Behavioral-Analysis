I'd really like to get some Middle Eastern food. Can you find a cheap place for me to grab some dinner?
I see that there are none, maybe I should reconsider the cuisine. Thank you
Okay, thank you. goodbye
There is no middle east food in that area, another place or type perhaps?
Are there any that serve Italian food?
There are 5 Italian restaurant options available. Is there a particular area of town you prefer?
In the centre of town.
There are 3 available. Which do you prefer: Pizza Hut City Centre, Ask, or Zizzi Cambridge?
Book one for 8 people at 18:45 on wednesday.
I have booked the Pizza Hut City Centre. The rederence number is XDDR16EJ . Is there anything else you need today?
We will also need lodging, preferably a 4 star guesthouse
There are 18 guesthouses with 4 stars. What part of town do you prefer? Or do you have a price range?
It should be in the same price range as the restaurant, please.
How about the Alexander bed and breakfast? It is in the same part of town and price range as the restaurant.
Do they have rooms available for the same day as dinner?
I'm sure they do, would it be for the same amount of people? And how many days are you staying?
Yes, it would be for the same group of people, and we will be staying 4 nights.
What day will you be staying?
Starting on Wednesday please.
Booking was successful. Your reference number is USCL95YH . Is there anything else I can help you with?
I will need a hotel between the two.
You would like a second hotel, for which night and location?
I'm sorry, I don't want a second hotel. I need a taxi between the B&B and the restaurant that arrives to the restaurant by the booked time.
Perfect I have booked you a yellow lexus. The contact number is 07350800727. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
