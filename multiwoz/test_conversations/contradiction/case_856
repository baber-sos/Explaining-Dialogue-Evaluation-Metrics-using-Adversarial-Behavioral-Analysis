I am looking for places to go in town I prefer a college.
How about Magdalene College? They're in the west side, and they have no entrance fee.
That sounds perfect. What is their address?
Their postcode is cb30ag an the entrance is free.
Okay what's their address?
The address is magdalene street. Would you like the phone number also?
No on the phone number. I now need help finding a cheap restaurant in the centre of the town.
There are many restaurants, do you know what sort of food you're looking for?
I have no preference on type of food.
Would you like dojo noodle bar?
Sure. Can I get the phone number?
Yes, their phone number is 01223363471. Would you like me to book a table for you?
No, I was just curious. I am also looking for a taxi between those two places.
I would be happy to help with that. Which is your departure site, and what time would you like the car?
I would like to go from the Dojo Noodle Bar to Magdalene College. I want to leave the restaurant by 12:15.
I've booked a car to take you from Dojo to Magdalene College. The vehicle is a white Honda, the contact number is 07882764497. Do you require anything else?
