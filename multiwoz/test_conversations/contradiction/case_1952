I'm looking for an expensive restaurant that serves gastropub type food.
There are 3 restaurants that fit your criteria, Royal Standard, The Slug and Lettuce and Backstreet Bistro. Are you interested in any of these?
Are any of these in the east part of town?
Yes, the Royal Standard is in the east. I would be happy to book a table for you if you can tell me the day, time, and number of people.
I want to book a table for 4 people at 16:00 on friday.
I am sorry booking was unsuccessful. Do you have another time slot in mind or possibly a different day perhaps?
