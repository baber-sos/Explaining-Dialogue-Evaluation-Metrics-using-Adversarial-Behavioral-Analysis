I would like to find some attractions in the west.
What type of attraction would you like to go to?
No specific preference, just need a recommendation
There are 5 colleges, an entertainment attraction and seven museums. They vary in admission price, how much would you like to pay?
I would like you to pick one and tell me the type, fee and the phone number please. Surprise me.
magdalene college has free admission and their phone number is 01223332138
Great, thanks. I am also wanting to find a place to stay. Ugh, I hate guesthouses though so it needs to be a hotel room in the west.
I have two choices in the west. One is in the cheap price range and the other is expensive. Do you have a preference?
I need it to have 4 stars please.
Both hotels have 4-star ratings.
You choose. Can you book me at one for 6 people for 3 nights starting Saturday?
Ok, I've made you a booking at the cambridge belfry, on back lane, cambourne, cb236bw. Phone is 01954714600. The reference number is JXGOPPRZ .
Thanks that's all the help I need today. Have a great day.
Glad I could help, bye.
