I would like to get some information about colleges to visit?
There is Christ's College, Churchill College, Clare College, Clare Hall, Corpus Christi, Downing College, Emmanuel College, and Huges Hall. Would you like me to list more?
May I please have entrance fees, phone numbers, and post codes?
I'll start out by giving you Christ's College. The phone number is 01223334900, the entrance is free, and the post code is cb23bu. Do you need more than that?
I would like to know the entrance fee.
It is free to enter the Christ's college. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
