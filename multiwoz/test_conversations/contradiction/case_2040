Hello, I am looking for a concerthall in the centre of town.
We have a concerthall in the centre by the name of the man on the moon, would you like more information?
What a neat sounding name! That might be a good fit. Can you tell me the address and postcode please?
The Man on the Moon is located at 2 norfolk street and their post code is cb12lf
Great what is the entrance fee too?
I am unsure if there is an entrance fee. Can I help with anything else?
Yes, I also need to find a train, please.
I'd be happy to help with that. Can you tell me where you will be departing from?
I need to depart from Strevenage, Wednesday, after 10:15. Arriving in Cambridge.
There are 7 trains that meet your needs. May I book one of them for you?
That would be great, how long is that train ride by the way?
The travel time for all trains to that destination is 49 minutes
Can you give me the arrival time of one of them? And the price please.
The TR6473 leaves at 11:54 and arrives by 12:43. The travel time is 49 minutes.
