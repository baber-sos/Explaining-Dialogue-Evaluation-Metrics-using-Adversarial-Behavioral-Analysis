I am traveling to Cambridge and can't wait to see some attractions. I am interested in a particular attraction.
Okay! What is the name of the attraction that you are interested in?
It is Trinity College. Can you tell me a little about it?
Sure it is one of Cambridge's most famous colleges and has a 1 pound entrance fee and is located on Trinity Street in the center of town.
Thanks. I also need a cheap place to stay while I am in town.
I have 10 hotels in town matching that requirement ranging from 0 to 4 stars guest houses and hotels. Do you have a preference for the area?
