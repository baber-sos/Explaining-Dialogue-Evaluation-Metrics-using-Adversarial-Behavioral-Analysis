I need a place to stay in Cambridge. I'm looking for a hotel with 0 stars.
Is there a certain area you would like to be in?
I don't really have an area in mind. I would just like for it to have free wifi and be a hotel instead of a guesthouse.
Cityroomz over in Centre would work perfectly for you then! They do have free wifi and are a moderately priced 0 star hotel. Would you like a room?
Yes, I would like to book it for 5 nights for two people starting on Monday.
I have booked the cityroomz for you for 5 nights starting on Monday. The reference number is MSZ63RPW . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Yes, I would also like to find a train from Cambridge.
