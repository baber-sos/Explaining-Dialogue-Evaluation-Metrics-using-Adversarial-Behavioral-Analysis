I'm looking for a restaurant in Cambridge called Nandos City Centre.
Nandos city centre is located at 33-34 Saint Andrews Street.
I want to book a table for 4 people at 15:00 on wednesday. Please give me a reference number.
Sure thing! Your reference number is LYIENP77 . Can I help you with anything else today?
I need to find a guesthouse style hotel please.
