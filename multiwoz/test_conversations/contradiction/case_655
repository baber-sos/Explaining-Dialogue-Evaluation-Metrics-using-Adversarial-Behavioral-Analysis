Hi, could you help me with my plans? I am looking for a train.
I can help you with that. Where will be departing and where do you want to go?
I will be departing from Cambridge and going into Ely on Saturday.
Trains run that route every two hours throughout the day. Do you have a target departure or arrival time?
I would like to arrive in Ely by 11:15. Could you please tell me the price and what the departure time is?
TR0718 arrives at 10:07 on saturday. Cost is 3.52 pounds. Would you like me to reserve a seat for you?
I need to book a room in the North as well.
There are 2 hotels and 11 guesthouses to choose from in the north, ranging in price from cheap to moderate. Do you have a price point preference?
I would need a hotel with wifi
There are 12 hotels that fit your criteria. Do you want a moderately priced or cheap hotel?
I don't care about the price. I absolutely do need free parking, though.
Do you have a star rating preference?
I do not have a preference on the number of stars.
Can I suggest the acorn guesthouse? It's moderately priced and has 4 stars.
I want it to be in the type of hotel. It should have wifi and parking too. And it must be in the north.
We have two option for you. We have the ashley hotel and the lovell hotel. Both have your commendations you want.
