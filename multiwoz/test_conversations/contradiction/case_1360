I want to find a European restaurant in the west.
There is one available, the cambridge lodge restaurant, would you like me to book you?
No, I'm just getting some information together. Is it expensive?
Yes it is an expensive restaurant, do you want to try a different restaurant?
Let's go with Cambridge Lodge. I'd like to book for 8 at 17:30 on Saturday, please.
