I need a Monday train, after 13:30 leaving time please.
I can help you with that. What day would you like to travel, what is your destination?
I would like to leave on monday and should leave after 13:30. I want it to go to london liverpoool street.
Ok Train TR1764 leaves at 13:59 would you like me to book that for you
Book it for 2 people.
OK, got your booking. The total fee is 33.2 GBP payable at the station, and the reference number is: Q4MDUZUT . Anything else today?
Yes, I also need some lodging accommodations. I'd like to find a guesthouse that offers free parking, please.
There are 21 guesthouses in the city that offer free parking. Is there a certain price point or area of the city that you'd prefer?
I want a moderate price range in the north.
That narrows it down to about 7 places. All of them are 4 stars except one. Might I suggest the Kirkwood House. They have great reviews.
Let's book that one then! Super excited! Same group of people, same day, 3 nights!
I was able to book at room at the Kirkwood House for you, Ref#Y7GS4CIZ . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
