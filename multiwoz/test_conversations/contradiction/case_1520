I am looking for something to do in the centre of town.
There's so much to do in the centre of town. There are museums, boats, concerthall, cinemas. What are your interests?
I think a theatre sounds nice.
I have the Adc Theatre on Park Street. Would that work for you?
Yes, that would be great. Can you give me the phone number, address, and postcode.?
