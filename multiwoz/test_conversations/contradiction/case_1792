Yes, I would like an expensive hotel in the center and what type of attraction is in the area in walking distance?
Would you like me to find a hotel first or the attraction?
I'm actually looking for a train. I need to go from Kings Lynn to Cambridge on Tuesday. I need to leave after 19:15.
TR4809 departs at 20:11, would that work for you?
That would be great. I need to reserve seats for 4 people on that train.
You are all set. The total fee is 39.2 GBP payable at the station the Reference number is 1I1USKBS
Thanks! Oh, I'm also looking for places to go in town at the city centre. I need some form of entertainment. Can you help?
There are many different attractions in centre. Is there a certain type that you'd like?
An entertainment attraction would be nice.
Sorry, I got no results for entertainment in Centre, is there something else I can look for?
Can you search for a theatre instead?
There are 4 theaters in the area, the ADC Theatre, Cambridge Arts Theatre, Mumford Theatre and the Cambridge Corn Exchange. Let me know if any of those appeal to you.
Can you give me the phone #, address, and postcode for the ADC theatre?
