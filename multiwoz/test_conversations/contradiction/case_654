Hi, could you help me with my plans? I am looking for a train.
I can help you with that. Where will be departing and where do you want to go?
I will be departing from Cambridge and going into Ely on Saturday.
Trains run that route every two hours throughout the day. Do you have a target departure or arrival time?
I would like to arrive in Ely by 11:15. Could you please tell me the price and what the departure time is?
