I'm looking for a place to stay. I'd like to stay in a guesthouse that doesn't need to include internet.
There are a total of 24 guesthouses available. Acorn Guest House has a 4 star rating, offers free wifi and free parking. Would you be interested in booking here?
Is that in the center of town? I do need to be in the center.
Acorn Guesthouse is not in the center, however I found two guesthouses that are. Alexander Bed and Breakfast is 4 stars. Would you like to book there?
Yes, please make my reservation at the Alexander Bed and Breakfast.
What day would you like to book on and for how long?
Could i get the phone number?
I am sorry I cannot find Acorn for you. I do however have a four star guesthouse called alexander bed and breakfast. How does that sound?
That's fine. Can I please have the phone number?
The phone number for the alexander bed and breakfast is 01223525725. Is there anything else I can help with today?
Yes, may I have the address?

I'm also looking for a restaurant that is in the expensive price range and serves spanish food.
unfortunately I do not find any expensive spanish places to dine. Would you like to try something different? Also the hotels address is 56 saint barnabas road.
Is there a restaurant in the expensive price range that serves british food?
There are 6 restaurants fitting that criteria. Is there a particular area of town that you would like?
I don't care
How about Graffiti? It is located in the west part of town.
Let's go ahead and make a reservation for 6 at 19:30 for this coming Wednesday. Oh, and can I get that reference number, too, please?
All right, you have a table for six at the Graffiti. Your reference number is 5DHN40HK .
Thank you for your time.
You're welcome. Can I do anything else for you?
No. That sounds like everything. Thank you.
