Hi, I am looking for information on a train.
You came to the right place! Where would you like to go?
I'd like to go to Cambridge and will be departing from Peterborough.
What time would you like to leave or arrive by?
I'd like to arrive by 10:30 on Thursday, please.
Great! I found 9 trains that match your requests. I'll be happy to book one if you'll let me know how many tickets you need.
I need to book seats for 4 people please, and can I get the reference number for that?
First let's verify which train you want. The TR1719 will have you at your destination around 10:09.
Yes, that sounds perfect. I'll need 4 seats.
Your booking was successful, the total fee is 66 GBP payable at the station . Your reference number is : P6G0S9IT . Is there anything else I can help you with?
