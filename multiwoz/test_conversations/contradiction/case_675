Hi there. Can you help me find a 2-star rated hotel or guesthouse?
ashley hotel is a 2-star hotel in 74 chesterton road
Does that include wifi?
yes it includes internet. would you like for me to book that for you?
Yes please, that would be great.
Ok perfect. Before I book, how many people will be staying at the hotel, what day you will be checking in, and how long you will be staying for please?
Thank you, I need to book for 3 people and 4 nights starting from Tuesday.
I completed your booking. Your reference number is 35W3XEDL . Is there anything else I could do to help?
Yes, I also need to verify that this hotel is in the east area of town.
Ashley is on the north, there is an option in the east express holiday inn by cambridge, which one would you prefer?
I actually really need a booking in the east. Is it possible for you to book me at the Express Holiday Inn by Cambridge instead? For Tuesday, 3 people 4 nights.
