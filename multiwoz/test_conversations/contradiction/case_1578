I need a train to arrive in cambridge by 19:30 on thursday.
We should be able to help you, where will you be coming from?
The train should go to london kings cross and should depart from cambridge at 19:30
If you are indeed traveling from Cambridge to Kings Cross, I recommend TR1791. It will arrive in Kings Cross at 17:51 on Thursday.
