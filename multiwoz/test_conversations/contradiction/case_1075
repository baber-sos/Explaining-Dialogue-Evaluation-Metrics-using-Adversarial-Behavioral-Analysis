I am looking for a cheap restaurant in the centre.
I have found many possibilities. Golden house is chinese and the river bar steakhouse and grill serves modern european. Are either of those of interest for you?
Yes, may I have the address, postcode, and phone number for Golden House? I'll book it myself.
