I am looking for a train that leaves on thursday going to cambridge.
There are 202 trains that meet what you are asking. Where would you like to depart from?
London kings cross, it should also leave after 16:30.
TR1149 departs london kings cross at 17:17 and arrives in cambridge at 18:08. Will that work?
Yes it will. Can you book that for just me, and provide the reference number?
Sure thing! How many tickets do you need?
I need one ticket and can I please have the reference number?
Booking was successful, the total fee is 23.6 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : R57G4DU4 . Can I provide any further help today?
I am also looking for places to go int town. I'd love for it to be sports related in the town centre.
We have four swimming pool locations. What do you think about those?
Do you have anything else that is not swimming?
Unfortunately, I'm not seeing any.
Okay what about any type of theatre? Which is your favorite?
adc theatre on park street is my favorite. Next would be The Cambridge Corn Exchange.
That's sounds good. Can I get their number and postcode?
The ADC theatre's postcode is cb58as and their phone number is 01223300085. Can I help you with anything else today?
