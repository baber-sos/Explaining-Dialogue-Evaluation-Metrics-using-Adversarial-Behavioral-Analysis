I'm looking for a moderately priced place to eat that's in the centre of town.
What type of cuisine are you looking for? There are 21 restaurants in that area.
I don't have a preference.
Out of the 21 restaurant choices, one is the Yippee Noodle Bar which is moderately priced in the centre of town. Would you like to make a reservation?
