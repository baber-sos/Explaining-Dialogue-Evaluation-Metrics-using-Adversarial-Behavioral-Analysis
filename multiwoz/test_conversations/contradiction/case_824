I have a name of a hotel that I'm looking to book.
What is the name of the hotel you are looking for?
The Gonville. Have you heard of it?
Oh yes! The Gonville is an expensive 3 star in centre of town. Would you like to book there?
Yes, that would be great.
I'll be happy to book that for you. First, can you tell me how many guests will be staying and how long you will be there?
I need it for 2 people for 4 nights staring on Monday please.
I have your reservation for 2 at the Gonville hotel for 4 nights, starting monday. Can I help with anything else?
thanks, what's the reference number?
Your reference number is YOGCIQVZ .
I also am looking for places to go and would like to find a museum to visit.
The Broughton House Gallery is a great museum located in the same area as the Gonville Hotel. Does that sound of interest to you?
Yes it does. May I please get the museum's phone number?
