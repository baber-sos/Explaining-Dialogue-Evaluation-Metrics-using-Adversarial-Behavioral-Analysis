I am looking for an expensive restaurant in the centre.
Oh there are many here in the centre! Did you have a particular cuisine type you were interested in?
I'm looking for a restaurant that serves chinese food.
We have four such places.
If you could find me one and if I could get the address, that would be great.
How about Sesame Restaurant and Bar at 17 Road City Centre?
