I need a train departing Cambridge arriving by 2030.
Which station are you traveling to, and on which day?
I need to go to Kings lynn on Wednesday and need to arrive before 20:30.
There are 5 trains. Would you like to leave at 5:11?
Sure. I'd like to book tickets for 6 people, and I'll need a reference number for the booking.
Booking was successful for TR5159, the total fee is 58.8 GBP payable at the station. Reference number is : 8F17UYO3 .
Thank you I am also looking for a park to visit in town
I have 5 terrific parks. Do you have a preference of location? Do you mind an entry fee?
Not really, but I would need the postcode of the park please.
Sure thing. There are several parks in town. Any particular area you would prefer?
No just a park. Which would you suggest?
I'd suggest Milton Country Park it has free entrance.
