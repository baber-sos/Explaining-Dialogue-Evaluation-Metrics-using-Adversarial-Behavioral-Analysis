I'm looking for a place to stay in the south of town. It doesn't need to have free parking.
There are 4 hotels that are in the area you are looking for. Would you prefer a 3 or 4 star rated hotel?
I don't care about the star rating as long as it's expensive.
The Lensfield Hotel is the only expensive hotel in the south area. Would you like any more information on this location?
That is perfect can you book that for me please.
The Lensfield Hotel is located in the South. It has a 3 star rating and is expensive. There is free parking and internet. I have booked it for you.
Thank you. Can you make sure that it's for 5 people staying for two nights, starting Saturday? Also, would you mind sending me the reference number?
