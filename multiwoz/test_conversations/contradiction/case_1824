I'm looking for a multiple sports location in the centre of town.
I'm sorry, there is not a multiple sports center in the centre of town, but there is one in the east if you are interested in that one.
Actually, I really want something in the centre of town. How about nightclubs? Any good ones in the centre of town?
Sure. Club Salsa is very popular. It is at 1 Station Road.
We would like to try that Club. Can you tell me the postcode and if they have an entrance fee? Thanks!
The entrance fee is 5 pounds.
What is the postcode for that? I am also looking for an indian restaurant near the nightclub, are there any?
I can only process one at a time would you like the post code or the nightclub info?
Postcode please, than search for an indian restaurant if you are able to
