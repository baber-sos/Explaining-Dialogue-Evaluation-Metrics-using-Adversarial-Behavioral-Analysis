I want to find a European restaurant in the west.
There is one available, the cambridge lodge restaurant, would you like me to book you?
No, I'm just getting some information together. Is it expensive?
Yes it is an expensive restaurant, do you want to try a different restaurant?
Let's go with Cambridge Lodge. I'd like to book for 8 at 17:30 on Saturday, please.
Reference number is : IPXE2SID . Is there anything else?
actually, i want to change the reservation to sunday.
Reference number is : ISJVY1RC . Is there anything else?
I am also looking for a hotel, it can be expensive, but it needs to have free wifi.
There are five expensive hotels, all with wifi. Could you tell me which location you are wanting to stay in, to narrow it down?
The area doesn't matter, which one would you recommend?
