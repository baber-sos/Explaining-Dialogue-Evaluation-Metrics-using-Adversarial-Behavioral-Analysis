I am traveling to Cambridge and looking forward to try local restaurants.
Glad to hear you're coming for a visit! What type of food do you like? I can help you find a great one.
I would like to find a train first. I need one on Sunday going to kings lynn.
I would be happy to assist you. Let's clarify your departure and destination points. Are you travelling from Cambridge to Kings Lynn?
Yes, that's correct. I need to arrive in Kings Lynn by 13:00.
TR5507 leaves cambridge for kings lynn on sunday at 12:11. Would that work for you?
