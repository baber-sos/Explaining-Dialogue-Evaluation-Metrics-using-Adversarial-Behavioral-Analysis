I'm looking for a restaurant in the centre of town
There are over 60 restaurants near the center of town, do you have a cuisine or price range in mind?
Yes, something in the affordable price range. Also, do any of them serve singaporean food?
There are no Singaporean restaurants, but there are cheap ones offering several different cuisines.
Okay what about Italian food then?
Zizzi Cambridge serves italian cuisine in the city centre. Would you like a reservation?
Not right now, but can I have their postcode, please?
Their postcode is cb21ab
Thank you. I am also looking for some places to go. Can you help with that?
I have a lot of different locales and attractions in my database, is there anything you'd like to see in particular? Or search by location?
What is there to see in the centre and what is the postcode?
There are 44 attractions in the center of town. Would you like a museum, or a cinema perhaps?
I prefer the cinema, is there one in the same postcode as the restaurant?
I only have one venue offering cinema in the centre but it has a different postcode than the restaurant. Vue Cinema's postcode is cb11ps. Should I look elsewhere for cinemas?
No, that one is perfect. Could you help me book a taxi please? I am looking for one to take me from Zizzi Cambridge to Vue Cinema. I'd like to leave by 22:15.
Of course. I've booked you a grey honda leaving from Zizzi Cambridge to Vue Cinema at 22:15. The contact number is 07135477113.
Thanks, that's all I need today. Have a good one.
You're welcome. Have a nice day.
