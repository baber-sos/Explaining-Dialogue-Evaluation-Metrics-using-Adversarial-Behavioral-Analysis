I need a taxi, please.
I'd be happy to assist you today. I'll need a little bit of information from you - let's start with what time you'd like to leave/arrive?
I need to get to restaurant two two by 5:15
Ok, I need a little bit more information, where will your taxi be departing from?
I want to be picked up at Williams Art and Antiques.
Your taxi is booked: a blue volvo with the contact number of 07690471186.
I look forward to the ride. Thank you.
You're welcome. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
No, that will be all. Thanks very much.
