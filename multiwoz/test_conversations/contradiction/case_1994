Hi, I'm looking for a train departing from Stansted Airport. I'd like it to arrive at the destination by 9:15.
Sure! It looks like we have four morning trains daily the are early enough for you. What day are you planning to travel?
I need to leave on Thursday.
We only have trains going to Cambridge then, is that your destination?
Yes, I want to go to cambridge. Can you make a booking for 7 people and give me the reference number?
