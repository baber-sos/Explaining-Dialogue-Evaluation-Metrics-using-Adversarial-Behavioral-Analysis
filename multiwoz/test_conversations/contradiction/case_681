I am planning a trip in Cambridge
Great! I can help you with any tourist information you may need.
I am sorry, I meant a trip into Kings Lynn. I am coming from Cambridge and looking for a train.
Ok, just tell me what day and time and I will be able to tell you what is available.
I'm leaving on Tuesday. I'd like to leave after 19:45.
TR9926 leaves at 20:11 and costs 20:11. how many tickets do i book?
2 people. I need the reference number too.
Ah, it appears that the earliest train, TR9926, leaves at 20:11, but it does arrive by 20:58. If that is okay, I could book that for you.
