I'm looking for a 2 star hotel.
There are 3 hotels that have a 2 star rating. Is there a price range you are wanting?
Not really, but it needs to be in the east and include free wifi.
The only hotel that is in the east with free wifi is express by holiday inn cambridge. Would you like to go ahead and book a room?
Yes, for two nights please.
