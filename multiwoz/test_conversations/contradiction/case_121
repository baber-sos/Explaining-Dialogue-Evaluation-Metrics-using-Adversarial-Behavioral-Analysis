I need a train to Peterborough that will be there no later than 17:15.
I have several choices, do you have a time for your departure?
I am looking for a train arriving in Peterborough.
And where will you be leaving from?
I'll be leaving Cambridge on Sunday.
I have train TR1086 that leaves at 16:06 and will have you in Peterborough at 16:56. Would this work for you?
