I'm looking for a restaurant in Cambridge called Nandos City Centre.
Nandos city centre is located at 33-34 Saint Andrews Street.
I want to book a table for 4 people at 15:00 on wednesday. Please give me a reference number.
Sure thing! Your reference number is LYIENP77 . Can I help you with anything else today?
I need to find a guesthouse style hotel please.
The a and b is a guesthouse style hotel in the east area.
What is its star rating? I am looking for a place with a star of 0.
I have results for 2 guesthouses with 0 star ratings, one is in the north and one is in the centre. Which area do you prefer?
