Hello, can you tell me about the options for moderately priced dining in Cambridge that are centrally located?
Yippee Noodle Bar (asian oriental), Restaurant One Seven (british), and The Oak Bistro (british) are all nearby
Are there any that serve Irish food?
No, sorry, there aren't any serving Irish food.
Perhaps a gastropub?
The cow pizza kitchen and bar would meet your request for gastropub. Would you like to book it?
Can I have the address for cow pizza kitchen please?
The address is Corn Exchange Street.
