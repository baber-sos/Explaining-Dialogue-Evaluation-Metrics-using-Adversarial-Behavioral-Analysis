I am looking for a train departing from Cambridge leaving on Tuesday.
I have trains departing long kings cross to cambridge on Tuesday every two hours starting at 5:00, would you like to make a reservation?
I need one that leaves after 13:30 for Bishops Stortford
How about the TR8017? It leaves at 15:29 and arrives at 16:07 in Bishops Stortford.
And this train leaves from Cambridge? If so could you please book it for 7 people and give me the reference number?
Yes, it leaves from Cambridge. I have booked this for you, and your reference number is GIXX2M35 .
I am also looking for a place to eat around the centre area that serves gastropub style food.
I found 3 places, would you like to try The Cow Pizza Kitchen and Bar?
Yes, please book a reservation for 7 people.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Can I get the reference number for that.
What day and time would you like the reservation for?
Also Tuesday at 10:00.
I could not book the restaurant for 7 people at 10:00. Would you like to try a different time?
Can you get a table for 7 at 9:00?
I was able to book that for you. Your reference number is 06TWFHH2 . Your table will be reserved for 15 minutes.
Ok great thank you for all of your help!
You're very welcome, I hope you enjoy your meal!
