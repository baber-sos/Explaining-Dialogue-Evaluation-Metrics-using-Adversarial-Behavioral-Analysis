Hey, can you help me out? I am looking for something to do. What kind of entertainment is out there in the center of town?
There are no entertainment attractions in the centre of town. Would you like to look in a different area?
That's not necessary. Are there any colleges in that area instead?
There are 13 colleges in town centre. Gonville and Caius college is on trinity street with free entrance. Do you want more information on any others?
That actually sounds great. Could you give me the phone number for Gonville and Caius college?
