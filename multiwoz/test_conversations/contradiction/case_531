i am planing a trip to cambridge and i need ideas on a place i can go in the centre
There is much to choose from in the centre. There are several architecture attractions to explore, boats and swimming, colleges, museums, parks, theatres and even nightclubs.
What do you recommend?
I recommend Whipple Museum of the History of Science. It's educational and free!
Okay that sounds fun.
Is there anything else I can help you with today?
What can you tell me about the Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge?
Sure it is located in the east and is in the expensive price range and their telephone number is 01223866800.
Can you book it for me please? I need it for 1 person and 5 nights starting on Tuesday.
I was able to book your stay at the Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge. Your reference number is YE0M6SG1 .
Great! Thanks. I was also hoping to book a taxi, can you help me with that?
Yes I can, what is the departure and destionation site, and when would you like to leave and arrive by?
I would like to leave the hotel by 02:45 to go to the museum.
Okay, I've got that booked for you. You're taxi is a yellow Honda and the contact number is 07272096370. Can I do anything else today?
thanks alot for helping
What else may I do for you today?
