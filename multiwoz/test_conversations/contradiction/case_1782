Hi, I need a train to Cambridge on Wednesday, please.
May I ask for your departure city?
I will be leaving from Stansted Airport and will need to get to Cambridge by 18:00.
I found a train that arrives at 09:52. Will that work?
That is very early, can i get one closer to 18:00?
The closest to 18:00 arrival time is a train that arrives at 17:52. Does this interest you?
Yes that's fine. I also need help finding an expensive indian restaurant. Can you help?
We have many of those! Cocum in the west is my favorite.
Is there anything near the centre?
Yes there are 6 to choose from, would you like me to book one of them for you?
Yes, please book me for 8 people at 21:00 on the same day. Thank you!
I'm sorry, there's no available seats at the time and day you've requested. Is there another day or time you would like to try and book for?
Can I get the departure time and price of my train reservation? Also, could you try to book my table for 20:00?
The departure time is 9:24 and the price is 80.8GBP payable at the station.
As for the restaurant Cocum, is that in the centre of town? I really would like to dine in the city centre.
Cocum is in the west, would you like to try somewhere else?
Yes. Please find an Indian restaurant in the centre of town.
There are 5 indian restaurants available in the centre of town. Is there a price range you are looking for?
Yes, the expensive price range please.
Curry garden is in the expensive price range, would that work for you?
Yes. Please book a table for 8 people at 21:00 on the same day. If 21:00 isn't available, please do 20:00. I will need a reference number too.
