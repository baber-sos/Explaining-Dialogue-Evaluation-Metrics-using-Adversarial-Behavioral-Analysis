I'm looking for a restaurant in the north part and in cheap price range.
sure, i have a couple options for you
Great, thank you! What are they?
There is royal spice which is a indian restaurant. There is also Da vinci pizzeria which is a italian restaurant. Do you need any more information?
Please book a table for 5 at 14:30 on Wednesday at Royal Spice. I will need the reference number. I also need to find a place to stay.
I was able to book your table successfully. Your reference number is KQMXIL0Z . Now, what type of accommodations are you looking for today?
The hotel should be in the same area as the restaurant and should include free wifi.
Do you have a price range or star rating preference?
I'd like a hotel, not a guesthouse, and I'd like a 2-star place.
I found two options that meet your criteria: Ashley Hotel and Lovell Lodge. Which one would you like?
I would like to book the Ashley Hotel for 5 people for 2 nights.
