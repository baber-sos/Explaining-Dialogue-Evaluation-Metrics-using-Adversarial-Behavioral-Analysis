Hello, I'd like some information on a restaurant today.
There are many options in Cambridge, do you have any tastes in particular?
I would like some British food.
There are 11 results for british restaurants. Is there a certain area or price range you're looking at?
I want something in the west area with a moderate price.
Saint Johns Chop House fits your request perfectly. They are located at 21-24 Northampton Street. Would you like to make a booking?
No thank you, but may I please have the phone number, address, and post code?
the phone number is 01223353110. the address is 21 - 24 Northampton Street, and the post code is cb30ad. is there anything i can help you with?
I also need a train to Birmingham new street on Wednesday.
I'd be glad to help you with that. From where will you be departing?
I'm departing from Cambridge and I'd like to arrive by 16:30, if possible.
