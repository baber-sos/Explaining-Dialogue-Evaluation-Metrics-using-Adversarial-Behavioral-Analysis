I need a place to stay in the west with 4 stars.
I would suggest the cambridge belfry. What price rage are you looking for?
I want a hotel.
There are two hotels that fit your criteria. One is cheap and one is expensive. Which would you prefer?
I don't care. I trust you. Please book it from Saturday for 5 nights for 7 people.
You are all booked at the Cambridge belfry. Reference number 27NHEG0N .
I'm also looking for a train. The train should be on the same day as the hotel booking.
There is a train, #TR4824 from London Kings Cross to Cambridge on Saturday at 09:17. Arrives at 10:08. It costs 18.88 pounds and takes 51 minutes to arrive. Is that ok?
