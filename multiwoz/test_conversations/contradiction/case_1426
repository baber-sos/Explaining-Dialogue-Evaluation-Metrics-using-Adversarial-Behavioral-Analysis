Can you help me find a particular restaurant that I'm looking for?
I would be happy to help. Which restaurant are you looking for?
The restaurant is called eraina.
Ah yes, the Eraina. It's an expensive European restaurant in the city centre. Would you like more info?
It was recommended by a friend, and I'm not sure what type of food they serve. Do you know?
