Can you help me find information on the Gonville hotel?
That is a great 3 star hotel. It is expensive, but beautiful. What would you like to know?
i want to book it for 5 nights
Okay, what day would you like me to make the reservation for and for how many people?
Book it starting from Friday and it will be for 4 people and I'll also need the reference number. We also need to find a place to eat.
Thee booking was successful and your reference number is WZJW5HIA .
Something classy nearby for dinner, preferably Italian or Indian cuisine?
There are many Indian restaurants. Were you wanting something expensive?
Yes I'd like one in the expensive range. If there's more than one whichever you recommend will be fine.
I would recommend Panahar, it is an expensive Indian restaurant at 8 Norfolk Street.
