I'm looking for an expensive restaurant that serves gastropub type food.
There are 3 restaurants that fit your criteria, Royal Standard, The Slug and Lettuce and Backstreet Bistro. Are you interested in any of these?
Are any of these in the east part of town?
Yes, the Royal Standard is in the east. I would be happy to book a table for you if you can tell me the day, time, and number of people.
I want to book a table for 4 people at 16:00 on friday.
I am sorry booking was unsuccessful. Do you have another time slot in mind or possibly a different day perhaps?
Is it available at 15:00?
Yes, booking for 4 on Friday at 15:00 was successful. Would you like the reference number for that.
Yes please that be great, thanks!
The reference number is N91XOAZT . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Yes, I'm looking for a hotel named Limehouse?
The Limehouse is a moderately priced guesthouse with a 4 star rating. Internet and parking are also provided. Would you like me to book this?
Yes, please - could you book it for 4 people for 4 nights please? Also, could you let me know the reference number?
I can, on which day would you like the reservation to begin?
Oh sure, start on friday please.
