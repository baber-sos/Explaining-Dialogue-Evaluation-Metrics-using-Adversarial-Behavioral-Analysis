It is a museum located in the west. Do you need more information?
Could I have the phone number please?
Absolutely! It's 01223338901. Is there anything else I can do for you?
I'm also looking for a train departing from cambridge.
Can you please give me the destination and the day and time you'd like to leave?
Yes, I'm going to Birmingham new street. It's on Thursday and I'd like to arrive by 15:30.
TR6576 leaves cambridge at 12:01 Thursday and arrives at Birmingham new street at 14:44. Would you like me to book that for you?
