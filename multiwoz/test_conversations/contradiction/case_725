Hi, I am trying to plan a trip and could use some help with the trains.
Okay sounds great! Where are you headed?
I'm leaving Cambridge and heading to Peterborough Wednesday after 18:45.
The TR8199 leaves after 19:06, would you like me to book you?
Yes, please book it for 4 people.
I was able to book it for you. Your reference number is DQDGTDH8 . Is there anything else I can help you with?
I also want to go to a museum in the center part of town.
