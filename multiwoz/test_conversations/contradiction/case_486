I am looking for a hotel to stay at located in the centre.
Ok. There are 3 hotels located in the centre of town. They are in the moderate and expensive price ranges. Do you have a preference?
I would like expensive, please.
The Gonville Hotel has 3 stars, and the University Arms Hotel has 4. Both meet your other criteria. Would you like to book a room at one of these?
