Hello, I'm trying to find a train that leaves from Cambridge and arrives here by 13:45 today. Can you help me book a ticket?
The closest arrival time I can give you is 11:51, is that ok? And how many tickets would you like?
That's fine. I don't want to book yet. Is the train you found going to Ely and leaving on Wednesday?
Yes i have a train that leaves on that day but that arrives around 12:07
Could I have the departure time for that particular train please?
That'll be at 11:50.
Thank you very much.
Is there anything else I can help you with? I can help with booking tickets if you would like.
Are there any restaurants that serve cantonese food in the east part of town?
Unfortunately, there are no cantonese restaurants on the east side. Would you like to try a different type of restaurant or area?
Try anything with Indian food, that would work as well. I will need the address if you find one, thanks!
I have found 4 indian restaurants on the east side. There are two moderate and two expensive. Did you have a price range in mind?
