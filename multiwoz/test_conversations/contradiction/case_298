I am trying to find a hotel in Cambridge called the Hamilton Lodge.
There is one guesthouse called Hamilton Lodge that is located at 156 Chesterton Road. Would you like to book there?
Yes. I would like to book for 5 nights starting Tuesday with a total of 6 people. Can I have the reference number?
Booking was successful! Your reference number is LNDHTG39 . Is there anything else I can help you with today?
I'm looking for the cotto restaurant.
The cotto restaurant is on East Road in City Centre. They are moderately priced and they serve british food. Would you like to reserve a table there?
