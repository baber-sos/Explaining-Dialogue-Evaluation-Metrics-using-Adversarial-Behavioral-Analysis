Are there any parks in town, by chance?
There is one in the centre, one in the east, one in the north and two in the south. Will one of these work for you?
Could I get the address for the one in the centre?
Sure. The Cambridge University Botanic Gardens are located at Bateman Street.
i need its address and phone number.
