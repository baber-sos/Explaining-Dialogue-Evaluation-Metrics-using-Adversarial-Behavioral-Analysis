Hi there. Can you help me pick out a restaurant?
I am able to, do you have an area, price range, or food type you'd like to try?
I would like to dine in a cheap chinese food restaurant that is located in the south. Can you help me find one?
The Lucky Star sounds perfect for you. Would you like me to make a booking?
No, can you please give the address and phone number for the Lucky Star. Thanks so much.
Yes of course. The Lucky Star's address is Cambridge Leisure Park Clifton Way Cherry Hinton and their phone number is 01223244277.
I am also looking for place to visit in the same area as the restaurant.
There quite a few attractions in the area. Is there one in particular you're interested in - maybe a museum? nightclub? cinema?
Can you make a suggestion and provide the type, phone, and address?
