Hello, I am looking for a concerthall in the centre of town.
We have a concerthall in the centre by the name of the man on the moon, would you like more information?
What a neat sounding name! That might be a good fit. Can you tell me the address and postcode please?
The Man on the Moon is located at 2 norfolk street and their post code is cb12lf
Great what is the entrance fee too?
I am unsure if there is an entrance fee. Can I help with anything else?
Yes, I also need to find a train, please.
I'd be happy to help with that. Can you tell me where you will be departing from?
I need to depart from Strevenage, Wednesday, after 10:15. Arriving in Cambridge.
