Hi, are there any trains from cambridge to kings lynn?
I have 133 results for trains going from cambridge to kings lynn, what day are you looking to travel on and what time would you like to arrive?
I need to leave on friday and arrive by 16:45
I have one that leaves at 14:11 and arrives in kings lynn at 14:58. Would this be acceptable?
Yes, I'd like eight tickets, please.
Great, your 8 tickets are booked (Ref#PHXZ03NH). Total fee is 78.4GBP, which you'll pay at the station. Can I help with anything else today?
Yes I need to find a nice expensive British restaurant please.
there are alot of restaurants that fit your needs what area would you like it in
The area does not matter. They just need to have an available table for 8 people at 10:45 on Friday night.
I am sorry none of them have booking available for that time,another time maybe?
Is 9:45 an available time?
I apologize. Can you verify that time for me again please?
I would like to book a table at 9:45.
I am not seeing anything available at that time. Maybe we can start from the beginning. You said you are looking for an expensive british restaurant right?
Yes. I would like a reservation on Friday at 10:45 for 8 people.
I am unable to get you a reservation at 10:45 would you like to pick another time or day?
