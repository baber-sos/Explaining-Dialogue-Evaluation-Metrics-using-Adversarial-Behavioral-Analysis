I am interested in booking a train to cambridge for next tuesday.
There are several trains departing for Cambridge on Tuesday. One train departs every hour starting at 06:08
I would like to depart from birmingham new street after 14:45.
There are 9 trains that depart from Birmingham new street to Cambridge on Tuesday after 14:45. The earliest is 15:40, does that work?
