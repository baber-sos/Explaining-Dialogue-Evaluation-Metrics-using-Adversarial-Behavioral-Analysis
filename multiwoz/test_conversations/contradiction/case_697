I am looking for a museum in town.
What area are you looking for?
Anywhere in town should be fine, I just need to know what area it is in.
We have 23 museums in various areas of town. Would you prefer an art gallery?
I trust your recommendation on a museum. What area is it in?
byard art is in the south on 14 king's parade, cb21sj. Do you want more information?
No that's it. I need a train going to London Kings Cross that leaves after 20:45 on Monday from Cambridge.
I have train TR2634 that leaves at 21:00 and arrives in London Kings Cross at 21:51. Would that work for you?
