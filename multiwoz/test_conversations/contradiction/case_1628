Hello! I am looking for information about The Cambridge Belfry. It's a hotel in Cambridge.
Certainly, it is a fantastic 4 star hotel in the west area that is very cheap with free wifi and parking! Would you like me to book it for you?
Before you book it, can I get the address of The Cambridge Belfry?
Of course! I have Back Lane, Cambourne listed as the address, is there anything else I can help with today?
No thank you, that is everything that I need.
Okay, thank you, and have a great day.
Thank you, have a great day, too.
