Can you find me a theatre?
Would you like the mumford theatre?
Yes and I need to know the entrance fee, address, and phone number
The fee is not listed but the address is anglia ruskin enterprise, east road and the phone number is 08451962320. Can I help you with anything else?
I am also looking for a French restaurant in the expensive range.
