Hi I am looking for a restaurant in the centre of town serving Indian food.
That's great! There are several Indian restaurants near the city centre. Are you looking for a budget conscious option or are you comfortable with a more expensive place?
A cheap option please.
We have mahal of cambridge, the ghandi and kohinoor, do you want me to book you for one of those?
Yes please for 5 people at 12:00 on wednesday.
You are all set. They will hold the table for 15 minutes and your reference number is QLT7JB37
Thank you, appreciate your service.
No problem. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I am also looking for a hotel.
