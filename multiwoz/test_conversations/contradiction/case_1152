I am looking for a cheap restaurant in the center of the city.
Do you have any specific type of food you would like?
No, I'm not picky as long as the prices are low.
There is a cheap Chinese restaurant called the Dojo Noodle Bar located in the centre of town. Would you like to book a table?
Yes please, for 8 people at 18:30 on thursday.
I am sorry but dojo noodle bar is solidly booked at that time. I can try a different time or day for you.
Can you try to book it at 17:30.
All set. Your reference number is K2BO09VQ .
Thanks. I'm also looking for some entertainment close to the restaurant. Any suggestions?
I am sorry I do not have any attractions meeting the criteria you listed. Is there another type of attraction or area you would like me to search?
Why don't you try an architectural attraction, instead.
All saints church looks good, would you like to head there?
Yes please. Can you let me know what the entrance fee is too?
Its entrance fee is free.
I also need to book a taxi between the restaurant and the church.
What time would you like the taxi to pick you up from Dojo Noodle Bar?
18:30, please.
