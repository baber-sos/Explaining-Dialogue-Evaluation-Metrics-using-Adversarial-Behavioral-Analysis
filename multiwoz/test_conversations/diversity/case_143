I need a place to stay in the north
Ok im seeing alot of choices in hotels is there anything else you need in the hotel that would help narrow it down
I'd really like to stay in a guesthouse . I heard the ones in Cambridge are very nice .
How about the Acorn Guesthouse? It is rated 4 stars and is in the moderate price range .
Is it in the north? And do they have free parking?
It is indeed in the north and offers both free parking and free wifi .
Do they have a room available for 5 people starting Tuesday? We will need it for 5 nights .
Alright, I got you booked . Your reference number is: DVD9MH3R . Anything else I can do for you?
Yes . I need to travel from Cambridge to London Liverpool Street on Sunday . Can you help me find a train?
There are no trains available on sunday leaving cambridge and arriving in london liverpool street . Can you travel on a different day?
Not really . Can you check again? I need to get to London Liverpool Street by 19:00.
