I'm looking for a hotel to stay at that has free wifi and a 4 star rating . Do you have any suggestions?
Acorn guest house is in the north with wifi and a 4 star rating .
That sounds great but I was hoping to stay in the south . Do you have anything else?
Yes I have two guesthouses in the south . One in the moderate price range and another in the cheap price range . Do you have a preference?
