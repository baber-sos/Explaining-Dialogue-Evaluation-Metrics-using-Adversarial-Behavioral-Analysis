I'm looking for a restaurant called "restaurant one seven". Can you help me?
It is in the centre of town located at De Vere University Arms Regent Street City Centre
That is the one . Can you make a reservation for 6 on Friday please? 12:00 would be good .
I booked that for your for a party of 6 at noon on Friday . The reference number is: 6WSK0KXY . Is there anything else you need?
What is the price range of this restaurant?
it's a moderately priced restaurant .
I am also looking for a place to stay in the centre . It should be cheap .
Alexander Bed and Breakfast is a nice 4 star guesthouse . Can I book a room for you?
Do they have free wifi?
They do . Shall I book it?
