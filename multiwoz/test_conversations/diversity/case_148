Hi, I'm looking for restaurants in the area that serve British cuisine . Could you give me some suggestions?
There are many Indian restaurants in the city . Could you tell me in what area you would like to eat?
Is there something available in the west?
Yes, there are 3 . Would you like something in the moderate or expensive price range?
I don't care about the price range . However, I need to confirm that the restaurant serves British food and is in the centre of town.
