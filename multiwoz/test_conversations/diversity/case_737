Hi . I'd like to find a very nice restaurant to go to .
Sure, are you looking for anything specific?
I am looking for something expensive and in the southern part of town .
Can I ask what type of food you are looking for?
It doesn't really matter . What can you recommend?
I have five places . The Peking is a nice place . Shall I book it?
Please, I'll need a table for 4 at 12:30 on Sunday.
