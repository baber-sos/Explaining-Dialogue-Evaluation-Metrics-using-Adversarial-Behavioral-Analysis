I'm looking for a pool somewhere in the south of Cambridge .
I'm sorry, but it doesn't look like we have a pool that matches your criteria .
How about some type of theater?
The Junction theatre is in the south area . Would you like the address?
Yes, please provide the address and postcode as well .
The Junction Theatre is located on Clifton way at postcode cb17gx . Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Thanks . Yes, I also need to find a guesthouse for my stay there .
Are you needing the guesthouse in the south, also? Do you have a preference in price range?
The area should be the centre . I need it to be cheap and have free parking .
I have 2 guesthouses that fit your criteria . One is The Alexander bed and breakfast and the other is El shaddai .
What is the star ratings for them?
the Alexander Bed and Breakfast has a 4 star rating while the El Shaddai has 0 stars . Would you like to book a room with either of these?
Ok great, thank you . I also need to book a taxi to get back and forth .
Where did you wan to leave from and go to?
I'll be leaving the theatre at 14:45 and going to the guesthouse .
Let's back up a moment . Which lodgings did you prefer, so we know where the taxi will be taking you?
Let's go with the Alexander Bed and Breakfast .
Your booking is complete, a grey volkswagen will be picking you up, contact number 07753429052 . Can I help with anything else?
Cool beans! Sorry I was so much trouble . Thanks so much for all of your help, you need a raise dealing with customers like me!
