Hi, can you give me some information on places to stay on my trip?
I can we have 33 places to stay, do you have any pricerange or area you'd like to stay?
I'd like one in the expensive price range that includes free wifi .
The University Arms Hotel is very nice and includes free parking as well as wifi . Does that sound good?
Sounds good, could you book me a room for three people for three nights starting Thursday?
I have made a booking here is the information-Booking was successful . Reference number is: VPNP1BF0.
