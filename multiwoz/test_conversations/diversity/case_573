What train do I take to get to Birmingham New Street? I need to leave after 17:00 .
There are trains departing hourly at 1 minute past the hour from 17:01 until 23:01 . All are 75.10 pounds, and take 163 minutes .
I am looking to travel on Monday . The first train at 17:01 would be fine . Can I get that train info?
