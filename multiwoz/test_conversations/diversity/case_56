I would like a guesthouse with free wifi please .
We have 23 different options available . Is there an area you would prefer?
I'm looking for something expensive in the north .
There are no expensive guesthouses in the north with free wifi .
OK, how about a moderately priced one?
There are 8 moderately priced guesthouses in the north . May I suggest the 4 star Acorn Guest house?
