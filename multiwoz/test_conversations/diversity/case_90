I am looking at a place to eat that serves venetian food in the centre .
Unfortunately, I don't see any restaurants that serve Venetian in the centre of town . Would you like to try a different area or type of cuisine?
Do you have any Chinese restaurants?
Yes there are 10 in the centre of town . Any price preference?
I was hoping for an expensive restaurant.
