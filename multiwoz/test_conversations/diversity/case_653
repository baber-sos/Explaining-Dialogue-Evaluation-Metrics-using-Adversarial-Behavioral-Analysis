I am planning a trip and need help with a particular hotel .
Do you have the hotel name?
carolina bed and breakfast, please . I want to book it .
Great . What nights will you be staying?
I will be coming in on Saturday for 4 nights with 5 guests .
Booking was successful . Reference number is: DCV1BNPM . Is there anything else I can help with?
Can you suggest any places to go in town?
Any preference on area or type of attraction?
Some entertainment in the centre .
I don't have anything specifically listed as entertainment in the centre . Would you be interested in something else?
How about architecture? I will need the entrance fee, phone number and postcode .
I'd recommend All Saints Church . The entrance fee is free, the postcode is cb58bs, and the phone number is 01223452587 .
Great . That is all the info I needed today .
Do you need me to book anything for you?
