Could really use some grub .
Sure . Is there any part of town that you'd like to look for food in?
Somewhere in the centre . I'm looking for some traditional food .
I'm sorry, but there aren't any traditional restaurants in the centre . Would you like to try another cuisine?
Ok, how about lebanese food?
Ali Baba is a great restaurant that fits exactly what you are looking for . Would you like me to book a table for you?
