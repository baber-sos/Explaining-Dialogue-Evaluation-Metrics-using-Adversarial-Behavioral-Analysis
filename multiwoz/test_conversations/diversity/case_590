Hi there, I'm looking for a restaurant that serves Swedish food . It can be anywhere, I'm willing to pay a moderate amount of money . Do you have any recommendations?
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find anything that matches your request . Shall we look for a cheap or expensive Swedish restaurant instead?
Sure, look for a cheap restaurant . And I prefer the west if possible .
Unfortunately there are none fitting that criteria either, would you like me to search for a different type of restaurant?
A British restaurant, please .
Saint Johns Chop House is a british restaurant located in the west at a moderate price . Would you like to book a table?
