Are there any expensive British restaurants?
Of course! We have a variety of them in the east, west, and centre . What area would you prefer?
I'd like for it to be in the West please .
I have two, Graffiti and Travelers Rest, shall I go ahead and try to book?
I am not quite ready to book a table, however I would like the phone number and address of each restaurant including the postcode.
