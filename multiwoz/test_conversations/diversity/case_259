Hello, I am looking for a restaurant in Cambridge . I believe it is called Golden Wok .
It is located at 191 Histon Road Chesterton
Can you book me a table for 11:00 on Friday?
Yes I can! Table for 1?
Actually, for 4, please .
Okay, your booking was successful! The reference number is MUFCMYFF . The table will be reserved for 15 minutes .
Great, can you also get me information or architecture in the area
Sure . There are several churches and an old schools attraction, all in the centre area . Do you have a preference?
What do you recommend?
old schools is lovely, they are on trinity lane and free admission
Can I get the postcode for that? I also need to book a taxi to the Golden Wok .
The postcode is cb21tt . Are you looking for a taxi from Old Schools to the Golden Wok?
Yes I do . I'd like to make sure I arrive at the restaurant by the booked time . Can you check?
