Sorry, Actually I need an expensive restaurant in the north . the first on your list would be great .
Sure how about Saigon City?
Sounds great, can you book a table for 5 at 18:00?
Alright, which day would you like the reservation to be on?
Actually, I won't be needing a reservation just yet . Could you verify the type of food Saigon City serves?
Saigon City serves asian oriental cuisine . Would you need anything other information or assistance?
