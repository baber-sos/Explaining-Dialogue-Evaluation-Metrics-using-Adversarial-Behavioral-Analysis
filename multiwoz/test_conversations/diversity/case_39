Are there any Catalan restaurants in the centre of town?
I'm sorry, there are no Catalan dining establishments in the city centre . Would you like to look for a different cuisine or area?
Actually, can you try anything that serves French food?
I have the cote in the centre . It is in the expensive range . Would you like to make a booking?
Yes, please . I need a table for 8 on Friday at 17:30, please .
Ok, you are all set for cote on Friday, table for 8 at 17:30 . Can I help with anything else?
