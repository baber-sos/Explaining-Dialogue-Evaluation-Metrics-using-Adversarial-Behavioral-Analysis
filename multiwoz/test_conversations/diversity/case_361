Hello, I am looking for information on a train .
I can help you with that . Where are you headed?
I'm headed to Cambridge from the Stansted Airport . Can you find information for Thursday please?
I found 19 trains what time do you want to leave the airport?
I need to arrive in Cambridge by 14:45 so I will need to leave in time to get there by then .
There is a train that leaves at 5:24 .
That won't work, I need to arrive in Cambridge by 14:45 (2:45pm).
Since that won't work for you, I can get you on a train that leaves at 13:24 and will arrive by 13:52 . Would you like me to book your seat?
That would be just fine . I just need the Train ID for now . I also need a place to stay.
