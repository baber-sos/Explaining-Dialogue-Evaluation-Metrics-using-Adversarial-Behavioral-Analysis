I am planning a trip in Cambridge,
How can I help you today?
I need to know what museums are in the area . Can you suggest one and let me know what area it is in please?
Is there a location preference?
I don't care what area it is . I was hoping you could make a recommendation .
What about the Byard Art museum in the south part of town?
Sounds great! I also need a train leaving on Thursday from London Kings cross .
Okay, there are 10 trains that meet your criteria . Would you like to narrow it down further by departure site or arrival time?
I need to leave after 14:15
TR5502 leaves at 15:17 and arrives 51 minutes later . How does that sound?
Yes . Please book of 3 people .
Booking was successful, the total fee is 70.8 GBP payable at the station . Reference number is: XQWTI43A .
Thank you for all your help . I really appreciate it .
You are very welcome . Enjoy your time at the museum . If you need anything else feel free to call again.
