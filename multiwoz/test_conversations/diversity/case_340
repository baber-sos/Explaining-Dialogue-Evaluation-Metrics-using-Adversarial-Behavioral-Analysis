Could you tell me if there are any corsica restaurants in the south side?
There aren't any corsica restaurants located in the south side .
That's fine, how about Chinese in the same area?
Yes, there are three Chinese restaurants in the South . Would you prefer cheap or expensive?
I am not bothered about the price . Why don't you select one and provide me with their telephone number and price range?
