I am planning a trip and could use some help with the trains .
Ok, what day, what time, and where to and from?
I would like to leave on Tuesday departing from Cambridge and arriving by 14:15 at London Kings Cross .
The TR0315 arrives at 13:51 . Do you want to book that trip?
Yes, please book me for 3 people, and can I get the reference number?
Your reference number is KHOLTDD9 . Can I help you with anything else today?
