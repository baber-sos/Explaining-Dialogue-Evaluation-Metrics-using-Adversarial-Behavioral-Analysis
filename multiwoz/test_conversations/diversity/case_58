Hello, may I have a list of museums in the west?
There are 7: Cafe Jello Gallery, Cambridge and County Folk Museum, Cambridge Book and Print Gallery, Kettle's Yard, Lynn Strover Gallery, Museum of Classical Archaology, and People's Portraits Exhibition (Girton College).
Please give me the entrance fee and postcode of County Folk Museum
The entrance fee is 3.50 pounds and the postcode is cb30aq . Would you like any other information?
I need a place to eat near the museum . I don't want to spend much so it should be cheap . What do you have?
In the west, I would only have 2 cheap restaurants . La Margherita is an italian place . And Thanh Binh serves vietnamese food . Which would you prefer?
I would like to go to Thanh Binh, please.
