I am looking to get on a train that departs from Ely on Thursday
There are 10 results of trains departing from Ely on Thursday . All are destined for Cambridge . Do you have any specific times that you would like me to look up?
The train should leave at 18:45
There's a train at 19:35 arriving Cambridge at 19:52 . Would you like me to book it for you?
Is there any train leaving sooner?
No, there is not .
Okay go ahead and book the one for 19:35 . I also need a hotel on the cheap side .
How many tickets will you be needing for the train?
