i am planing a trip to cambridge and i need ideas on a place i can go in the centre
There is much to choose from in the centre . There are several architecture attractions to explore, boats and swimming, colleges, museums, parks, theatres and even nightclubs .
What do you recommend?
I recommend Whipple Museum of the History of Science . It's educational and free!
Okay that sounds fun .
Is there anything else I can help you with today?
