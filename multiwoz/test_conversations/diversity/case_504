Are there any 4-star hotels which are moderately priced?
We have 11 guest houses which are moderately priced, but no hotels .
A guesthouse is fine . I'm looking for a place in the north with free parking .
Acorn guest house is available if that works for you .
That's good . Can you book it for 3 people?
For how many days and starting what day?
Starting Friday for 4 nights . There will be 3 guests .
I'm not able to book for those nights . Would you want to try a shorter stay?
Yes, that would be fine . Is there a room available for one night?
I was able to get you 1 night at the Acorn Ref #E45FQB5O . Can I help you with anything else today?
