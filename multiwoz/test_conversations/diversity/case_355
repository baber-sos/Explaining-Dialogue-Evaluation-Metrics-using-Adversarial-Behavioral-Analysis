I'm looking for some type of entertainment in the centre of town, can you tell me what is available?
Can you be more specific? There's a lot of different things to do, like restaurants, shows, clubs...
Are there any museums?
There are 11 museums in centre, all with free admission . What type of museum would you like to visit?
Any of those museums will work . Will you select one for me? I need their phone number, please .
How about the Fitzwilliam Museum? The phone number there is 01223332900 .
That's great . I also need some place to eat someplace moderate that serves corsican food.
