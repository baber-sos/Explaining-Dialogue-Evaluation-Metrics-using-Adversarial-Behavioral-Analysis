Hi, I'd like to find some place to go in the east . What's good to visit?
There are several places would you like an entertainment attraction or a museum?
Can't you suggest something please? I need the address, attraction type and postcode when you find it please .
How about Cambridge Artworks? It's a museum on the east side of town, and they have no entrance fee .
That sounds great . What's their address and postcode?
Their located at 5 greens road and postcode cb13ef .
Thank you . Can you book a train for me? I'm leaving on Monday and I would like something that arrives by 12:15 .
