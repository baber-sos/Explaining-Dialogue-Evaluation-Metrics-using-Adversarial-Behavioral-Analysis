Hi, I'd like some information on nightclubs located in the west please .
My system is not pulling up any Nightclub attractions in the West . Is there another attraction type or area you would be interested in searching?
How about a college to visit in the same area .
Magdalene College is located in the west and is free to visit . Would you like more information on it?
What is the postcode there?
The postcode is cb30ag . Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes I need a train that is departing on Wednesday from London Kings cross .
Is there a certain time you would like to leave London? And will you be travelling to Cambridge?
Yes, I'm headed to Cambridge and need to leave after 09:30.
