rosa's bed and breakfast is a cheap 4 star guesthouse located in the south at 53 roseford road . free internet and parking .
I'd like to book it for 6 people and 3 nights starting from thursday . Can you do that for me and provide me with a reference number please?
Your reservation number is L4FIU0QG . Is there anything else I may help you with?
Suddenly I'm hungry, could you find me a fancy expensive restaurant in the centre area?
There are a lot of possibilities, what type of food are you suddenly hungry for?
British? My favorite .
Fitzbillies Restaurant meets your criteria .
OK, can you reserve a table for the six of us?
Would you like this reservation be for Thursday?
