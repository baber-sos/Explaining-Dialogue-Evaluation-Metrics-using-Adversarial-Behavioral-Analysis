Can you help me find a place to eat? I am looking for somewhere in the east with a moderate price .
There is the Curry Prince and Rajmahal restuarants serving Indian food . Then there is the Pizza Hut Fen Ditton serving Italian food . Which would you like more information on?
I think I'd like to try Rajmahal . Could you book me a table for 1 on Monday at 16:15?
