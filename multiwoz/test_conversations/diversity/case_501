I am looking for a train departing from Cambridge that will arrive at bishops stortford .
There are many trains that leave Cambridge and arrive in Bishops Stortford, what day and time would you like to leave?
I would like to leave on Thursday and arrive no later than 18:00 .
I have found six trains leaving on Thursday with the latest leaving at 15:29 and arriving by 16:07 . Would you like to book this?
That sounds like a good one . Can I please have the reference number?
