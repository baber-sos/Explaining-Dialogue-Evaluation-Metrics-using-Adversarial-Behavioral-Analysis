I would like to book a train .
OK, let's narrow this down a bit . Where are you traveling to, what day are you traveling, and at what time?
After 19:00 on Friday from leicester to cambridge .
Okay great, there are 5 trains leaving after 19:00 . The earliest being 19:09 and arriving by 20:54 . Would that work for you?
Yes, I think the 20:54 arrival time should work .
How many tickets do you want for this TR4365 train?
One ticket please .
Ok. You are booked . Your reference number is 231K9BOE .
Also can you help me with finding information on an attraction called Ballare?
No problem . It is a nightclub located in the centre, located at heidelberg gardens, lion yard and charges a 5 pound entrance fee .
Wow, that was exactly what I needed . Thanks so much!
You are very welcome . Is there anything else I can help you with?
