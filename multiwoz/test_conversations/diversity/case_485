i'm looking for a place called kambar
Sure, I found it! It's located at 1 Wheeler Street . It's a nightclub in the city's centre and it has a 5 pounds entrance fee .
Please give me their postcode
The postcode for Kambar is CB23QB .
I also need a place to stay, a hotel with free parking and in the center of town .
I have 2 hotels in the expensive price range and 2 guesthouses in the cheap price range . Do you have a preference?
