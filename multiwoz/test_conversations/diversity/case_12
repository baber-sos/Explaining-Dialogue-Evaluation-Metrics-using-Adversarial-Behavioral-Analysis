Hi, I am planning a trip and need some recommendations for a place to stay while I am there .
Can I get an area you would like to stay in?
In Cambridge, I need a cheap guesthouse please
There are 9 cheap guesthouses . Is there a particular part of Cambridge you would like to stay in?
I don't really care . I do want a guesthouse with free WiFi, though.
