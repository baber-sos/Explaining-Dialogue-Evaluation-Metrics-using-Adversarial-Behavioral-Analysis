Hi there! I'm looking for an expensive place to stay that has free wifi . I bet Cambridge has a ton of those .
We have 5 hotels that fit that description . What area of town do you prefer?
The area doesn't matter much, but I would like it to be a guesthouse if possible .
I'm sorry, but all of the places that have free wifi and who have an expensive price range are hotels rather than guesthouses . Would you be interested in a hotel instead?
I'd really rather stay at a guesthouse . Do you have anything in the cheap price range?
