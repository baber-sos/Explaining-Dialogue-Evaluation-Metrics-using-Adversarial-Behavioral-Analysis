There is a great cinema on the south side called Cineworld Cinema . The are located at cambridge leisure park, clifton way . Their phone number is 00872208000 . Is there anything else?
Yes, what is the postcode? Is there an admission fee?
The postcode is cb17dy, and it looks like there isn't an admission fee . Is there anything else you'd like to know?
Can I also get a train leaving after 16:45 on sunday?
I also need your departure and arrival cities please .
The arrival city is obviously going to be Cambridge ...... I'll be coming from Duxford
I'm sorry, there are no train departures from Duxford that match your criteria . Can you leave at another day or time?
I'm sorry . I'd be departing from cambridge to norwich . Can you double check that?
