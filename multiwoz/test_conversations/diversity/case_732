I'm so bored, can you find me some kind of entertainment in the city centre please?
I'm sorry, there are no entertainment attractions in the centre of the city . Would you like to try a different area of the city?
What about a nightclub somewhere?
Sure, there are plenty of those in the centre . I'd recommend Kambar, located at 1 Wheeler Street . Can I get you more information?
Can I also get the phone number and entrance fee?
The phone number is 01223842725 and the entrance fee is 5 pounds . Can I help with anything else?
