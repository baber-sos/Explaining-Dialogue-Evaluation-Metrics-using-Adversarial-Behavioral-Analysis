User: Hi!
System: Hello. How's your week coming along?
User: It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
System: Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?
User: I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
System: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.
User: Ah, good thought, thanks!
