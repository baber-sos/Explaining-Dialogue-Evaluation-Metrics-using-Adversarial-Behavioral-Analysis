User: Hi!
System: Hey, how are you?
User: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good
System: ohh, what kind of "hint" did it have?
User: watermelon
System: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor
User: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange
System: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?
User: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird
System: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream
