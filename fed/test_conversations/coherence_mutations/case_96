User: Hi!
System: Oh hey. How's your day been?
User: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
System: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.
User: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
System: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.
User: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
System: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.
User: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
