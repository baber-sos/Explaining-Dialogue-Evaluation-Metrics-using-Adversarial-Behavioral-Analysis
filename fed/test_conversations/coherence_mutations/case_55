User: Hi!
System: hello there, how is it going?
User: Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
System: that's nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?
User: No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
System: thats very impressive then, congrats!
User: Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
System: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball
