User: Hi!
System: Hi
User: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
System: Sure, whats the scenario?
User: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
System: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.
User: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
System: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.
User: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?

System: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.
