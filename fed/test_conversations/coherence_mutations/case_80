User: Hi!
System: hey
User: is it raining pretty bad today?
System: yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options
User: surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
System: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P
User: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
System: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down
User: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
System: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here
