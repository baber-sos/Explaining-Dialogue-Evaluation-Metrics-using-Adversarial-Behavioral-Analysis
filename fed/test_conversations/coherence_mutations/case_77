User: Hi!
System: Wow, hello. Can't believe we are finally talking!
User: Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?
System: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.
User: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?
