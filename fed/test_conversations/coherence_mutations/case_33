User: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
System: oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?
User: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
System: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?
