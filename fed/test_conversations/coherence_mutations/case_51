User: Hi!
System: hello there, how is it going?
User: All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?
System: I'm quite tired. There are a lot of things I need to finish before the end of the year.
User: oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation
System: yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?
User: I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.
System: staying at home is always nice during the holidays
