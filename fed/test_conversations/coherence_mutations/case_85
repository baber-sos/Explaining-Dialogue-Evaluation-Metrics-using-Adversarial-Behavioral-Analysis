User: Hi!
System: Wow, hello. Can't believe we are finally talking!
User: Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?
System: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.
User: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?
System: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.
User: Hehe! How long was the stay?
