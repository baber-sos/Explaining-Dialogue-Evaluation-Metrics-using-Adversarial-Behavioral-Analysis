Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !
I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !
But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !
Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !
