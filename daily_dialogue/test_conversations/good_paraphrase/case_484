It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession .
The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .
Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .

I think the main point is economic growth, we need more jobs. Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries, the result is an increase in unemployment in our own country, lower consumption, lower production, and an overall sluggish economy. If more people are working, it will give the economy a boost.
