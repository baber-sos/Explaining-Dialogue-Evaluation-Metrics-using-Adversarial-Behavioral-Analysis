So what do you think of my new dress ?
I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
Um , ninety-five dollars ?
Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
