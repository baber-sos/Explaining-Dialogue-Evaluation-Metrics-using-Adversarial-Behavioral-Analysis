Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?
Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?
Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?
When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports .
I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?
