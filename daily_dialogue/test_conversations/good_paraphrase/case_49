Hello ! How do I get more amenities ?
I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand .
I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .
Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities .
No , no . I've got plenty left .
Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
What am I going to do about souvenirs ?
Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !
Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
