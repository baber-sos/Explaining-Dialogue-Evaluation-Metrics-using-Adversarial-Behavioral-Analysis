You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?
Yeah , about .
Do you know Chinese better now ?
Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .
Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
