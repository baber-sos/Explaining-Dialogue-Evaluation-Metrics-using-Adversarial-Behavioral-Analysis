What kind of gas does this car take ?
I don't know . It's a rental .
I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ?
Sure , why not ?
That is the pump you are in front of .
Is it expensive ?
It is the most expensive .
Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?
Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .
Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ?
I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .
