Where are you going ?
I'm going to buy a CD .
Why not listen to music online ?
Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ?
You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .
I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened .
