Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?
I am cooking now !
Are you good at cooking ?
I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !
It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !
I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?
Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .
That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
I have the same idea as yours .
It's OK . Please have a taste of it .
Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .
Thank you for your praise .
