Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?
Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !
I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .
Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
