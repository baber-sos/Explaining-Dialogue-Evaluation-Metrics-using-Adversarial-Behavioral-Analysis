Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !
Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
Me too .
Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
