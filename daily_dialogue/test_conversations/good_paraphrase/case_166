Do you take a bus to and from work ?
Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .
Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .
Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
