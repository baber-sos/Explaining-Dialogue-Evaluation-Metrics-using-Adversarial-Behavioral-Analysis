Have you ever tried shopping online ?
No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .
That's right . Seeing is believing .
I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .
That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
