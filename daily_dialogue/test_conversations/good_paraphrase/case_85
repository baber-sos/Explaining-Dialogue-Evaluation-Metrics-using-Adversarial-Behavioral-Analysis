I hate computer games .
Why ? They are fine .
Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting .
Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good .
If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .
Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games .
