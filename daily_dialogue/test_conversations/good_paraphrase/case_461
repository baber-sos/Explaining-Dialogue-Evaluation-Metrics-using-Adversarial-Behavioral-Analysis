How do you decide what grade we get ?
I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests .
What is the most important factor ?
Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning .
How can we keep track of our grades ?
The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .
What if we can't get to school ?
You can only miss one class without penalty .
If we have a major problem , will you let us know ?
