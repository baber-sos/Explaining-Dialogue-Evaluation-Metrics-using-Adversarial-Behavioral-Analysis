The hotel operator . Anything I can do for you ?
I've been trying to get through to the booking office for the last ten minutes . But the line has been engaged all the time . Why is it taking so long ?
I'm sorry to hear that . I'm afraid it is often the case during the peak hours . Shall I ask them to call you when the line is free ?
OK . Please do so if it is not troublesome .
No trouble at all . May I know your name and room number ?
I'm Du Juan , in Room 312 .
