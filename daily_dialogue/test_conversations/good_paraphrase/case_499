What's wrong with you , young man ?
Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache .
Do you have a fever ?
I don't know , but I feel terrible .
Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious .
Do you think I should lie in bed ?
Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two .
OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ?
