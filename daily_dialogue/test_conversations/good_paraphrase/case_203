I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .
I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .
And it takes up all the news .
The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .
I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
