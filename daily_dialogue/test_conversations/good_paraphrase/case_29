What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?
We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .
How hard is the climb ?
It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
What did you do last week ?
We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting .
Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it .
