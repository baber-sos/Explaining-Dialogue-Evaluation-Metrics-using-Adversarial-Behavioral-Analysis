original_conversation
Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names .
That's OK .
The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .
Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared .
Thank you .
Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .
