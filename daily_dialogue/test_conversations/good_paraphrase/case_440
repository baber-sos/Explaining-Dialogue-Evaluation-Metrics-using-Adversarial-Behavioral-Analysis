Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ?
I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?
That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .
A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?
A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .
We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
