I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports .
It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .
What about a draft at 120 days sight ?
All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
So do I .
