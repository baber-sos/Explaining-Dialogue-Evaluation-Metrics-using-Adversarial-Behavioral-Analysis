that was a really good meal , Gordon .
It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite .
well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .
you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .
let's see how much the bill is .
don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .
what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .
no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .
no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .
that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .
just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?
