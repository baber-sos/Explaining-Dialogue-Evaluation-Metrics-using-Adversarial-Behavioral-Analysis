Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?
Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?
Either way is good for me .
There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ?
I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also .
We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home .
