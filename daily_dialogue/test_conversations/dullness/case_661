It's time for bed .
But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ?
It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight .
I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .
Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .
You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?
Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
