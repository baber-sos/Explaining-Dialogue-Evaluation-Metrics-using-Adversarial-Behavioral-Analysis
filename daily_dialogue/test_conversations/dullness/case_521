Do you believe in UFOs ?
Of course , they are out there .
But I never saw them .
Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .
You mean that you can them .
That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
They come to the earth ?
No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .
