I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking .
I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please !
How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more .
You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ’ d be lost without you . I won ’ t let you go anyway .
