I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday .
Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer .
You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ?
To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression .

That is a great question.
