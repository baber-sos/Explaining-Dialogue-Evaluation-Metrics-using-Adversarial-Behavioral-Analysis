Hey , could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ?
The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ?
Yes , I pretty much understand the company .
Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ?
Yes , I've been observing them .
When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ?
I already have something to wear .
I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ?
OK , I am ready to think of other things .
You need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . You'll do great !
