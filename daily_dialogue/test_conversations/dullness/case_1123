Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO .
I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again .
Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .
Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it .
