Can I help you ?
Yes , I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have ?
Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ?
Mostly cassette tapes .
Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good .
Kreng ? I've never heard of that company .
It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone .
I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .
Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ?
Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks .
Hmm . You know , the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often ?
