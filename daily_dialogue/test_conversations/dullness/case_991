I need help with the office party .
Yes , of course . We could split it . What part would you like to do , the food or the entertainment ?
I have no idea what the entertainment should be .
Let's make sure we are on the same page . Do we want a formal or informal gathering ?
Let's make it a formal affair .
Yes , that would be best . Now , for food should we have Chinese or American food ?
American food would be the best choice .
