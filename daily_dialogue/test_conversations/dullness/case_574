How silly of you to jump out of the window !
But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake !
Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .
That would be too late .
Maybe the situation is too urgent .
Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .
