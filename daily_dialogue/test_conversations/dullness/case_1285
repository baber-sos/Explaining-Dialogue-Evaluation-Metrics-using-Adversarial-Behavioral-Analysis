Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?
Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content .
Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?
Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .
I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .
Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .
Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
