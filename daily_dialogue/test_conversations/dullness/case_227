What game do you like ?
I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .
I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated .
It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .
I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?
I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money .
Do you play bridge ?
Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .
I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?
Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .

Let me think what I have to say about that!
