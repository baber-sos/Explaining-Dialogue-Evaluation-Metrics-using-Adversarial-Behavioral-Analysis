This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee .
If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .
What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .
I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?
What's your proposal ?

That is a good question.
