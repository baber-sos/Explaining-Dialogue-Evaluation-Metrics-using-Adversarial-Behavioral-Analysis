Hi . Have you got a personal computer ?
Certainly . What's the matter ?
I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .
Is the service charged ?
No . it's free .
