Why are you so quiet ?
My girlfriend just broke up with me .
You must feel terrible now .
Yeah .
I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too .
You've been through this too ?
Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .
But it hurts too much .
I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .
What if I don't want to find another girl ?
You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .
