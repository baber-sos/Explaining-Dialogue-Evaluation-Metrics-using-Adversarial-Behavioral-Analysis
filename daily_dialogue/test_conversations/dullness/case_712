Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ...
You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous .
Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while .
OK , OK !
Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
Well , that's kind of obvious .
Give me a break , Mr Yang .
