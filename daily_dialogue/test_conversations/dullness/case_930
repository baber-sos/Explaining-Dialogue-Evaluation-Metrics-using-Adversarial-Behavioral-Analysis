I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday .
What words ? Can you tell me ?
He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .
Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .
