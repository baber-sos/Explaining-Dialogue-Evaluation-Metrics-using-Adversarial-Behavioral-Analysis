It's your turn now , Helen .
OK . I'm coming .
This is your song . I picked it for you .
Thank you . You are so considerate .
Push the red button on the mike to turn it on .

I think it's a piece of cake for you .
OK . Let me have a try ...
Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day .
Thank you . I'm sure you will .
