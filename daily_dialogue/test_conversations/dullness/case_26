May I help you ?
Give me a Big Mac , a small order of French fries and a medium Coke .
You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer .
That's fine .
Your total comes to $ 7 .
Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .

I don't know what you mean by that.
