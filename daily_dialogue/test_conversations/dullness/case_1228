Steven , I'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow . Can you give me some advice ? And what should I pay attention to ?
First , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . Most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight .
I will go to bed early tonight .
Do you have an airsickness ?
I don't know . But I have a carsickness .
