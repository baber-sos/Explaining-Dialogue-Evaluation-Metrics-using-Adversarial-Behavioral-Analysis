Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith .
I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment .
Do you know when he will be back ?
He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week .
Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?
Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .
Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ?
