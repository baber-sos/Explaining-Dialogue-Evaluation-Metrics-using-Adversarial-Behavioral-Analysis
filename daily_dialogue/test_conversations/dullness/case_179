Hello , Nancy , nice to see you .
Nice to see you , too . I heard you are a staff of Nokia company .
Yes , I ’ m satisfied with this job .
Congratulations . What did you do during the interview ?
Pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . Good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . Good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable .
