Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?
Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?
Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .
That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?
