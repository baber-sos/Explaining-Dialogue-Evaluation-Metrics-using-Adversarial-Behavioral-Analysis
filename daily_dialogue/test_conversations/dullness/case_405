May I see your ticket and passport , PLS ?
Sure , here they are .
Any luggage ?
Just this suitcase .
Your backpack is very big and today's flight is quite full . I am afraid that you will have to check your backpack too .
No problem . What about this carry-on ?
You can take that with you .
Can I have an aisle seat , PLS .
No problem . I'll give you an aisle seat in the center row . And here is your ticket , passport and boarding pass . Please board the plane at Gate 15 .
Thank you . And when is the latest time for me to board the plane ?
15mins before the plane takes off . The plane is scheduled to leave on time .
Thank you very much !
