I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ?
I'd be glad to .
I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country .
Do you have an account with this bank ?
I'm afraid not .
In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application .
What is the interest rate on your card ?
The annual charge rate is 9.5 % .
That's very expensive !
Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe .
How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?
You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
Does the card provide any other benefits ?
