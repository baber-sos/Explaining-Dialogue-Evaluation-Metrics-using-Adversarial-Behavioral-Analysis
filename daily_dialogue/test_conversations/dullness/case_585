What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today .
You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not .
Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .
It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
Yes , they say I would get a big sum .
Have you discussed it with your wife ?
