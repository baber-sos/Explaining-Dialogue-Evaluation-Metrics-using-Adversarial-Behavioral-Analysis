I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !
God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ?
Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .
They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
