Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ?
My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ?
Two years or so .
That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ?
No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .
Do you enjoy work here ?
It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
