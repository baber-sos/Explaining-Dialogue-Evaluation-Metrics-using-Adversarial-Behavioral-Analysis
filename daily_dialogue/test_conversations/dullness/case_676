I'm searching for an old music box .
You came to the right place . Any particular decade ?
If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .
We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six .
Would any of them have dancing figures ?
Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think .
That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ?
One last question
Oh , no . Everything we sell here is " as is . "
I guess I was asking for too much .
If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet .
