When was America discovered , Tony ?
I'm not certain . Do you know ?
America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 .
In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ?
All right . Ask me a question now .
Who invented the electric light bulb ?
That's easy . It was invented by Edison .
