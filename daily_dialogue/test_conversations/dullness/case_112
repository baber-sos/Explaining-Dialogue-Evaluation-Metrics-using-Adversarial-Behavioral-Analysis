Tell me about yourself and your past experience .
I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company . I interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments .
How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
I can type 100 Chinese words a minute and take dictation in English at 150 words a minute .
Can you operate computers skillfully ?
Yes , I can . I have received some special training in computers . Besides I am good at operating common office machines , such as fax machines and duplicating machines .
Sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . How do you feel about that ?
That's all right . But could you tell me how often and how many hours I should work overtime ?
It just depends . If we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . It's not unusual .
Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question .
OK , please .
What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ?
Nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities . However , you know , our company is an international trade-oriented company , can you handle English papers and write English correspondence ?
Yes . I specialized in English secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job .
What are your salary expectations ?
I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position .
The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence .
I think it's acceptable and I really like the job . And when can I know the decision ?
We'll inform you of our final decision by early July . Do you have any other questions ?
