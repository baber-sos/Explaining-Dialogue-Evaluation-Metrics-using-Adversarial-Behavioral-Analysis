Tell me about yourself .
I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics . I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd .
What type of position are you looking for ?
I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .
Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .
What is your greatest strength ?
I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
