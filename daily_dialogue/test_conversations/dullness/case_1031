You have a lovely house , Jack .
Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately .
That's too bad . What problems are you having .
Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ?
Go right ahead .

That is a great question.
