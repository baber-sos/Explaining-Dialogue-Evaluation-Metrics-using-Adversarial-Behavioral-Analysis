Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game ?
I was unable to make it .
You should have been there . It was intense .
Is that right . Who ended up winning ?
Our team was victorious .
I wish I was free that night . I'm kind of mad that I didn't go .
It was a great game .
What was the score at the end of the game ?
Our team won 101-98 .
Sounds like it was a close game .
That's the reason it was such a great game .
The next game , I will definitely be there .
