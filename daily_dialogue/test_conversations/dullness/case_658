It's especially cold when the wind is blowing .
Why don't you wear a scarf ?
What can wearing one do for me ?
You're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . It's not because your jacket isn't thick enough .
So wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket .
Yes . That's the secret to wearing a thin jacket .
You know , sometimes I can't feel my ears and fingers .
I'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own .
Thanks , Pam . You're my lifesaver .
