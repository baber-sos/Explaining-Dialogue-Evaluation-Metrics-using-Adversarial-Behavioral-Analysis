Hey Stacy . What's going on ?
I'm pretty tired these days .
Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?
I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .
How about your husband . Does he help much ?
Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
That sucks .
