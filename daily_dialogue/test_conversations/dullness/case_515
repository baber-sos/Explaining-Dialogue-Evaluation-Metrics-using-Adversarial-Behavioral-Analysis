Mary , it's good to see you !
Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by .
I am so glad that you decided to stop by !
Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .
Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?
Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .
