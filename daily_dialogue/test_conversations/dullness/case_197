Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !
What is it ? What happened ?
I think someone is stalking me .
No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
