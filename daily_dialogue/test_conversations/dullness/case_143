I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !
We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .
I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
