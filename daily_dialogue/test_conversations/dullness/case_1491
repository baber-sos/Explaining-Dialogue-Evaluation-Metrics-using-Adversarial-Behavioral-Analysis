I just stayed at home and watched TV .
did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?
yes , it was a very evenly matched game .
what were the results of the game ?
it ended in a tie .
what was the actual score ?
it was three all .
really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .
if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .
what happened ?
their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .
that explains it .
