Did you watch the final last night? My favorite singer won!
Oh, I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
Yeah, he got booted after his initial performance in the audition, but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately, in the third audition, he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him.
