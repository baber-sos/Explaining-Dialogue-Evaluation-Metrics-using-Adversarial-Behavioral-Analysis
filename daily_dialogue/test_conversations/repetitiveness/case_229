I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone .
It's ok . What do you want to ask ?
Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?
The first place you should go is the International Center .
Why ?
You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .
