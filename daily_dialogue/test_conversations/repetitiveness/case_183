You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ?
Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful .
So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?
Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .
Do you do the same exercises every day ?
