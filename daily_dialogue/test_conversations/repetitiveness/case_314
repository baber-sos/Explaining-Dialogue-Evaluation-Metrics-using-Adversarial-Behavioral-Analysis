Morning, Peter . Nice suit! A new one?
Oh, yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm, you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .
Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
That's right . You know, pink, green and black could also be good for you . Actually, I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example, black could make you look mature, while pink could make you look young and energetic.
