Hello?
Hey Tina . What are you doing?
I was just watching TV . What's going on with you?
I just watched a movie and I'm scared .
What did you watch?
I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
If you're not busy, do you want to come over? I'm afraid to be alone .
Sure . I can come over . What should we do?
How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .
Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
Hurry, ok . It's dark out .
Don't worry, nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon.
