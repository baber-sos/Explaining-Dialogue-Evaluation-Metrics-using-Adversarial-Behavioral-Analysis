We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years .
That's excellent . How have you managed that?
Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .
What does that mean exactly?
Well, we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
What other sources of energy do you use?
We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power.
