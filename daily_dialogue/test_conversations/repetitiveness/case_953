Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements .
Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .
And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .
There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .
