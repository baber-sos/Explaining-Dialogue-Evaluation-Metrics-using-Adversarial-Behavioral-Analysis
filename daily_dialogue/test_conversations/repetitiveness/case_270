Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China?
Yeah, almost . But there is one thing .
What?
I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China, but...
What is it?
Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
That makes you feel uncomfortable?
Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue, reading a newspaper story, the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
Well, that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus.
