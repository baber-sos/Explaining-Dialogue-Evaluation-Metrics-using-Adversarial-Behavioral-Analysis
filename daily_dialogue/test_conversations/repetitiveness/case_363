Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ?
Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?
I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .
Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .
Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .
