Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts .
But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills .
What do you mean ?
They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets .
That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .
