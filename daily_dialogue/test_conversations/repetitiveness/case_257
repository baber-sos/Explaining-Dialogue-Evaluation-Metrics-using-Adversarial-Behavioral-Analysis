Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?
Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?
First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
How do you research your books ?
I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .
Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?
There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .
