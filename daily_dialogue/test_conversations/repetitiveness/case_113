First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations .
That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff .

Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .
Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ?
The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ?
Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month .
When will the branch office open ?
Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .
Has and advertising campaign been prepared ?
Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines .
