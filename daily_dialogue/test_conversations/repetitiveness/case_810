How far do we have to go?
About 50 miles .
The traffic is not very heavy on this high way, is it? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it .
No, but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon .
Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet .
But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend, isn ’ t it?
