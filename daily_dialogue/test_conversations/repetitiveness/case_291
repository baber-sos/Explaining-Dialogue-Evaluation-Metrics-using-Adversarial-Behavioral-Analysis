Is there anything wrong ?
I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college .
Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .
I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .
You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .
But I just want to give her some tips .
Oh , she can make her own decisions .
