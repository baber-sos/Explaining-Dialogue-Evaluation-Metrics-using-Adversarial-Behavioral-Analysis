I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?
Alright .
It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
