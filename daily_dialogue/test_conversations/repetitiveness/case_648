I need help using the washer and dryer .
Tell me what the problem is .
I can't figure out how to turn them on .
Do you have some quarters?
I didn't know I needed change .
The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
Where do I put the change?
The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in, and the machine will turn on .
Is that everything that I have to do?
