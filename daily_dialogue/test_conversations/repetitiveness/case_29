Hi . What's your name ?
My name is Jung Min . What's your name ?
My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you .
Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ?
No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
Why were you in Japan ?
My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
That's pretty cool .
I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
