Listen, Karen, I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .
I'm glad to help you . What's wrong?
My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her?
Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold, and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
You need a babysitter .
Yes, I'd ask Jill, the girl I've had before, but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .
I could have Suzy stay at my place .
I don't want to do that to you, Karen .
Why not?
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know, Sara Ralston.She is 17, and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church, and I trust her completely .
I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice, I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .
I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free.
