I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .
I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays, they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .
Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .
Can you ride a horse?
Yes, I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you?
I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend?
