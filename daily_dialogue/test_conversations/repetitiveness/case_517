hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ?
well , I spend a lot of time watching movies .
what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too .
oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ?
actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ?
art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .
really impressive . These two genres are totally different .
sure . I enjoy both of them very much .
how often do you go to the cinema ?
once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon .
movie salon ? where is that ?
it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there .
