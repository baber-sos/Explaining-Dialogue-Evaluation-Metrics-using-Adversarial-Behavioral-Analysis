Hello, Sir . So, you are back?
Yes, hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .
That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit, the interest is fixed, but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term, the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .
And I can purchase that here?
Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us, the Insurance Premium can be paid through it, which saves all of us a lot of hassle.
