I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines .
Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm?
It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls .
That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck .
Do you have any product that controls frizz?
With the cut I'll give you, we will minimize a lot of that .
Thank you!
And when we're done, I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest.
