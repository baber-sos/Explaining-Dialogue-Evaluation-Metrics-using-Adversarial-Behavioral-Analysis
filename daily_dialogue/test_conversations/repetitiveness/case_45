how long will it take us to drive to London ?
I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway .
that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours .
you ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas .
