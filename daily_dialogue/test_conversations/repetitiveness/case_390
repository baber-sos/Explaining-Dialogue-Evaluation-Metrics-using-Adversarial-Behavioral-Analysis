It ’ s so great to be here! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home!
We ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house?
That ’ d be great, but could I have a cup of tea first?
Sure, I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
That would be lovely, thanks .
Do you take milk or sugar with your tea?
I ’ ll take a little milk, but no sugar, please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup.
