The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round, okay?
Sure, but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close .
That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place?
It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door?
Yeah . I think I can find it .
You're back already . That sure was quick .
That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
Well, the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .
Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air, anyway .
Okay, let's go!
