Can I help you?
Yes, I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have?
Well, we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio?
Mostly cassette tapes .
Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good .
Kreng? I've never heard of that company .
It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse, recording capability, and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone .
I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .
Really? Have you had an auto-reverse break before?
Yes, twice now . I think it's too high-tech, and so it's the first part that breaks .
Hmm . You know, the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often?
Well . No, I didn't clean it.But still, I only had the last one two months, and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse .
Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band, built-in microphone, recording capability, and no auto-reverse .
How much is it?
This one sells for $39.99 .
Can I test it out?
Of course .
It sounds great . I'll take it.
