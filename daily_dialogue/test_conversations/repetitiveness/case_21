Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?
Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?
Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .
I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .
Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?
Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?
That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?
Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .
I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .
Well , it's all new stock in the window now .
May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?
Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .
