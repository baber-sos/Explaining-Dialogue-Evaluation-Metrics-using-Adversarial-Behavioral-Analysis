For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party .
That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library!
I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .
Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people.
