Come on, you are left behind!
Wow, I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast, honey .
You just need more exercise .
Yes, but you need to slow down . This is jogging, not racing!
I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .
But running so fast is not good for people over forties .
Why?
We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us.
