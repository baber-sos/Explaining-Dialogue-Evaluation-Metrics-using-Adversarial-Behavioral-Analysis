Whew! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line .
You have much patience .
Wow! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait!
Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .
What does it say?
This is an especially famous one . It says "May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
That's very nice . Is it for sale?
