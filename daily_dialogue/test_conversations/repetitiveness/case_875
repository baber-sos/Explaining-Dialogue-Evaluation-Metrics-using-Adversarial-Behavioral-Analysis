Hi , Dan . What's new ?
Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days .
I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ?
I got fired .
How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
