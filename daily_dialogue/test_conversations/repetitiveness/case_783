Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?
Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .
Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .
I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .
Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?
