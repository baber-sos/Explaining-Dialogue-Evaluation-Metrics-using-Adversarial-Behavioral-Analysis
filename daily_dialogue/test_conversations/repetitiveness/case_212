Joe, how are you doing?
I am great! How about you, Mary? How are you?
I am doing great! Thank you for asking, Joe .
I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight?
I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night?
What were you planning on seeing?
I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ”?
That's a chick flick!
