Hi, Jack, how have you been?
Not very well .
Why? Looks like you're feeling very down! What happened?
Nothing .
Come on . For a man who's feeling so, down, there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill, or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful, it must be the latter .
Well, you're right . I just broke up with Jane .
Oh, I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .
Well, you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down, but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young.
