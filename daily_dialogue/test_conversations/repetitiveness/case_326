Hey Stacy . What's going on?
I'm pretty tired these days .
Why? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands?
I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids, cook, clean, laundry, and the cycle never ends .
How about your husband . Does he help much?
Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that?
That sucks .
If he wasn't so lazy, I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn, but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it?
