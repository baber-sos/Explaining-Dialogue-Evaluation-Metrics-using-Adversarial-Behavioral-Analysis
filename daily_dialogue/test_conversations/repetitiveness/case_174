The plumbing in my new apartment is not working .
I need you to tell me what the problem is .
The bathroom sink is stopped up .
Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also, or just the bathroom plumbing?
Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
Did this just start happening, or has it been going on for a while?
Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem?
