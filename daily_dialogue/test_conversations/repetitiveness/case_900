What's up? You sound a little down in dumps .
I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .
Calm down! Shouting won ’ t help?
He is really outrageous .
What happened?
I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog, so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep, because Brian was there in the living room, playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me.
