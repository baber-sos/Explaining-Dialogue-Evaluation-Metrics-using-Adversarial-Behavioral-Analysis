I'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position .
Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all .
Do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ?
We will let you know probably next Monday . I hope to give you a positive reply .
I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision .

Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
