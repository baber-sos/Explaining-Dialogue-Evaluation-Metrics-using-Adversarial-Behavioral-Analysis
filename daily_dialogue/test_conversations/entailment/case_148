Why don't you watch where you're going ?
Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .
I think my arm is broken .
Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .
Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?
Alright .
It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
It really hurts .
Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
