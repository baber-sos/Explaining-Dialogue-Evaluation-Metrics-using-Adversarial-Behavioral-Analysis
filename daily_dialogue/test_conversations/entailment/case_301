Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?
Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !
I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .
Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .

Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average .
