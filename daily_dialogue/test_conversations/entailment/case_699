hi , Lander . What's wrong ?
I can hardly make ends meet these days .
same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
is that inflation ?
inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
how ?
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
sounds a good idea .
