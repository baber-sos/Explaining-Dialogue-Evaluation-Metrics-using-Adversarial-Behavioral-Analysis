You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw .
Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening .
Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night .
Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please .
I knew you'd see it my way .
Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?
