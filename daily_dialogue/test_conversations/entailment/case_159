The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening .
Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?
Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .
Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?
I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
