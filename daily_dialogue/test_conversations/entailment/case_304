Steven , shall we go shopping tomorrow ?
Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping .
But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don ’ t mind , that's OK .
Hum.Maybe it will be better . The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work .
