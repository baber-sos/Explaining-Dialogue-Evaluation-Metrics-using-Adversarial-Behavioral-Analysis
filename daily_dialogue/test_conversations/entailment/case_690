What kind of personality do you think you have ?
I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done .
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better .
