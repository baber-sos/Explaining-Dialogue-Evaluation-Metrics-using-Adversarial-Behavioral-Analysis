I'm so glad I bought this watch !
Cool ! Flashy red lines !
I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .
Is it waterproof ?
Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
Well , surfing , scuba diving ...
