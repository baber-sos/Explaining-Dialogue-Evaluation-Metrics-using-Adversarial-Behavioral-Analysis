John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year .
I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska .
You can't be serious !
Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .
After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .
Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .
