Professor Li , do you know where to buy art supplies ?
For what ? Are you taking up painting ?
No . I can't paint . I'm asking for my niece . She is really into it .
Oh , good . How old is your niece ?
She is eight . Actually , I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift .

Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
