I'm a little nervous .
Don't worry . You'll be fine . First of all , put on your seat belt . Adjust the mirrors .
You don't think I'll need the seat belt , do you ?
Of course not . But it's a good habit to put it on every time you drive .
Just in case , right ?
Right . Hold the steering wheel with your hands at ten o'clock and two o'clock .
