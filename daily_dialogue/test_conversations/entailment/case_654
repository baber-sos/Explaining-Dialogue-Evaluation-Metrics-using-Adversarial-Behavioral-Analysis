I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why .
Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ?
I am afraid that I forgot to send it in .
We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks .
Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ?
It can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .
I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem .
You can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it !

Your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time .
