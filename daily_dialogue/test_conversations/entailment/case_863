What are your personal weaknesses ?
I ’ m afraid I ’ m a poor talker . I ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking .
Are you more of a leader or a follower ?
I don ’ t try to lead people . I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together .
Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?
Yes , in most circumstances .
