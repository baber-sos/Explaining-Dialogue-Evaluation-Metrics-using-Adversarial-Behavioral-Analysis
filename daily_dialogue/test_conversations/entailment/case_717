What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .
I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .
come on , nothing can be that bad .
but promise me , you'll keep it a secret .
ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?
I've fallen in love with my boss .
really ? Is he married ?
no , of course not . He is still single .
then what's your problem ?
I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .
office romance is very tricky .
