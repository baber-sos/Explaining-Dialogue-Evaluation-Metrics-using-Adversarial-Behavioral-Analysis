What do you think about the equipment in our company ?
We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible .
I also realized this issue . And office automation is essential .
Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age .
Good idea . A network of work stations is helpful for our management .
And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function .
