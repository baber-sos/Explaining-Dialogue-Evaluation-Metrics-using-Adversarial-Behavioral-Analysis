What type of position are you looking for ?
I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .
Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .
What is your greatest strength ?
I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
What is your greatest weakness ?
I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .
Why do you want to work for our company ?
After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team .
