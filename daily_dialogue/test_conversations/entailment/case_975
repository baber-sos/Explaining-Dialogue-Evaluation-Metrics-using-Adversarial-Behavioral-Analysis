What date would you like to depart , sir ?
Do you have any seats for September 16th ?
Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th .
The 17th will be fine .
And what date will you be returning ?
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you're booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
