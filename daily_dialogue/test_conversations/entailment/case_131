what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset .
to be honest , I was just dumped .
oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up .
no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling .
come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ?
I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ?
where is that ?
