I called HP about my computer .
What did they say ?
They said I need a new hard drive .
That's too bad . How much is a new one ?
It's not too much , only about $ 85 .
Plus installation ?
No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
Really ?
Yes , it's just a couple of screws .
That's nice .
It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you .
