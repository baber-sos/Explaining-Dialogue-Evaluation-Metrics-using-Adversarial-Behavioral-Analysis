Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?
Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?
Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?

Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .
