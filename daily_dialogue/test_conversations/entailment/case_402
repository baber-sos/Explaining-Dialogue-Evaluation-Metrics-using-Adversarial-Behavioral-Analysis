I hear you are expecting your family .
Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .
I didn't know you had a brother .
Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often .
Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?
His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .
Does your brother have just one son ?
No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .
I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
