Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?
Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?
Either way is good for me .
There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ?
I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also .
We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home .
I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .
I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day .
I would like to see as many as possible .

Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it .
