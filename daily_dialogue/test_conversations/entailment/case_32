Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?
Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .
But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?
Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .
It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?

Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .
