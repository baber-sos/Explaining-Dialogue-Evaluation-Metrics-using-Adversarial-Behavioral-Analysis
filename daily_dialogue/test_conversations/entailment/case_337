I ’ m fed up with marriage .
Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife .
Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time .
But now you are rich .
And we have some squabbles on some boring things .
This is ordinary marriage life .

You can have a free facial and then make up free for you . Do you want it now ?
