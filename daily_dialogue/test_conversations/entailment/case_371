We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !
Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !
What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .
Yay !
