did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?
why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .
well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .
do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?
no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
what do you think about abortion ?
I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
