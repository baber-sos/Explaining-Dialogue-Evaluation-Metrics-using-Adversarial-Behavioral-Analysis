Good morning , Sir . Where are you going ?
I ’ m going to England by flight BE987 .
When is your flight ?
10:00 AM . When am I supposed to check in ?
we are checking in . May I have your ticket and your health certificate and your luggage please .
Here you are .
Are you keeping the small bag as carry-on luggage , sir ?
Yes .
You must weigh that as well .
all right .
Your luggage is two pounds over . I ’ m afraid They'll be in excess luggage charge , Sir .
How much must I pay ?
