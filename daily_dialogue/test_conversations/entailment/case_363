I ’ m forming a music band .
Do you already know how to play an instrument ?
Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band .
Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?
We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ?
Yes , I ’ m a singer .
Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house .
