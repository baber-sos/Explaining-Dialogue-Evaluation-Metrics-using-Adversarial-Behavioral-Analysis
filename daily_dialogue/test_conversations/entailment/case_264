I'm searching for an old music box .
You came to the right place . Any particular decade ?
If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .
We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six .
Would any of them have dancing figures ?
Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
