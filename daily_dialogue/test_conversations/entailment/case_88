I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ?
I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax .

Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ?
To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .
What kind of music do you prefer then ?
I like pop music . Do you ?
Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth .
I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .
How long have you been in to pop music , then ?
I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ?
Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .
So , how did you become interested in it ?
Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started .
