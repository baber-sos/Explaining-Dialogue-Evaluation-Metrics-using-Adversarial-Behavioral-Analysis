I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ?
What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp !
It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .
The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .
Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
