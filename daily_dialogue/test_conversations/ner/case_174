Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ?
Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains .
Oh , do you go hiking often ?
I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .
It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend .
