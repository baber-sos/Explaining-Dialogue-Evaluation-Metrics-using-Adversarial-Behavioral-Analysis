Lili , let ’ s take a vacation !
George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent .
Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much .
