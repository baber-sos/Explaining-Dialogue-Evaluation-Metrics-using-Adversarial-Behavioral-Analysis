Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?
Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .
Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .
I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .
Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?
Nothing .
What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .
Promise that you won't get angry .
OK , I promise . What is it ?
It's a kitty .
Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .
