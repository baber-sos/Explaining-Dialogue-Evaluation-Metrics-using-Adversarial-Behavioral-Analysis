What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Brown ?
I'm in pretty bad shape , Dr . Ford .
Oh , in what way ?
No appetite , always on edge , and I can't sleep well .
Did you lose any weight ?
Yes , I have lost quite a few pounds since last month .
When was the last time you had a check-up ?
About two month ago .
Let me take your blood pressure . You look anemic .
Well , Mr . Brown , I'm happy to say it's nothing serious .
