I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes .
So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food .
Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice .
