Mr . Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening . Here's an invitation for you .
How nice of him . I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ?
If you could be ready by , say 6:30 o'clock , I'll be at the hotel to pick you up .
That's great . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Rose .
