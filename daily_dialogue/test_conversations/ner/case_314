have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ?
I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table .
you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish .
who's the director ?
it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ?
yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ?
sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now .
that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?
no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .
how much does the magadize cost ?
it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .
that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ?
Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .
