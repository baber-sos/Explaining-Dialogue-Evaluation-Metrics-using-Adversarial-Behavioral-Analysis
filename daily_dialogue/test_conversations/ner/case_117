Yes . What did you think of it ?
I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?
Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?

Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?
Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?
Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
