have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?
sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
to begin with , I have to use chopsticks .
but you look quite proficient in using them now .
