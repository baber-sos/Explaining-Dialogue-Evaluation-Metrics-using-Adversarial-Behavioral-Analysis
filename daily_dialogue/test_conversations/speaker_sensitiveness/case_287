Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ?
Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long .
Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name .
