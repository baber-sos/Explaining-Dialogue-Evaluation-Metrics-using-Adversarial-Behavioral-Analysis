Hey , taxi .
Where to , sir ?
Beijing Library .
Hop in , please .
Is it a long ride to Beijing Library ?
It will take about thirty minutes because it is the rush hour .
Thirty minutes , that will be all right . There are still fifty minutes to go before the library is open . Look , what are they doing on the square ?
It is an exhibition of Chinese jades . It is held each year . A nice collection jades of are on display and sold .
Sounds great ! Can you stop somewhere here for a minute ? I will get some souvenirs for my friends .
