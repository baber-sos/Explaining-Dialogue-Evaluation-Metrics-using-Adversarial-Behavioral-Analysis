Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?
I don't want to .
Well , come over and talk to me then .
Certainly not .
May I turn on the TV then ?
Turn on the TV for what ?
So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?
I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .
To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .
