So , Monica , how do you like your new office ?
Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place !
That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
What was so bad about it ?
Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
