The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .
Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .
No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .
You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?
Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .
Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?
