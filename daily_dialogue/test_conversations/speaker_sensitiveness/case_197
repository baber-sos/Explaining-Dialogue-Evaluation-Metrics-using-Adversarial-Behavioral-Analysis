I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went .
First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?
I am not sure what a home inspection is all about .
I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in .
Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ?
Sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of .
Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?
