I ’ m going to be moving out soon .
You still have time on your lease .
There ’ s no way that I can stay here .
That ’ s not going to be all right .
I don ’ t understand why .
I ’ m going to have to keep your deposit
Why can ’ t I have it back ?
Because you ’ re leaving before your lease is over .
You have to give it back to me .
