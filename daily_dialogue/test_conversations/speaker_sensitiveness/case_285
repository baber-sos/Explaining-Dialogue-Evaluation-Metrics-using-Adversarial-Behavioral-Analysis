I'm interested in Chinese antiques .
We have a great variety of Chinese antiques . Besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting .
I'd like a flower-and-bird painting .
How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty .
Oh , they look just like live cranes .
And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
