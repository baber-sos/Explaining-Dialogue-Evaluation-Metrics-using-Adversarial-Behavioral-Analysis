my lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place .
I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
Do you know any places ?
well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
