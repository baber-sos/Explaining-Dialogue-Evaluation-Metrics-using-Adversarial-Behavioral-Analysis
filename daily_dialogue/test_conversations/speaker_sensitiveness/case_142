Have you seen the tower in front of us . That's the famous Eiffel Tower . It was built in 1889 for the World's Fair .
How tall is this building ?
It stands 320m ( 1050ft ) high and held the record as the world's tallest structure until 1930 .
I have heard its name is connected with someone , is that right ?
