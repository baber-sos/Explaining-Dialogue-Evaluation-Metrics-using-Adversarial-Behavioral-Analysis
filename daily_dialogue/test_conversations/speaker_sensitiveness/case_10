Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line .
You have much patience .
Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !
Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .
What does it say ?
This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
That's very nice . Is it for sale ?
No . I never sell my artwork .
Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
I give it away . Here , this one is for you .
Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
