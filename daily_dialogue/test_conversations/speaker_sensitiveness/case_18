I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods .
I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself .
What foods do you eat now ?
I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
Those are the only things you eat ?
That's basically what I eat .
Why aren't you eating anything else ?
Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
And the chicken ?
It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
I guess that does sound a lot healthier .
