I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ?
We have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences .
Experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ?
Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ?
Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go .
