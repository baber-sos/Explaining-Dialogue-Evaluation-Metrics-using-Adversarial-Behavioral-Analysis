Do you consider yourself a good mother ?
Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman .
How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .
I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
Does your husband feel the same ?
