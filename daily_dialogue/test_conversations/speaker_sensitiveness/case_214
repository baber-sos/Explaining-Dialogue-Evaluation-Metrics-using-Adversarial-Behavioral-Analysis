original_conversation
I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth .
let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .
I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people .
you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .
I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense .
we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?
that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
