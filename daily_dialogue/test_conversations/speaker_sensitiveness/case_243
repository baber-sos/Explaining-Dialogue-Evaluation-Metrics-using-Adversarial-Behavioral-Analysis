I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes .
I'm ready when you are , sir .
Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York .
You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine .
I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ?
Sir , right here we have a storage site . Its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .
A deposit ? Isn't my luggage a deposit ?
