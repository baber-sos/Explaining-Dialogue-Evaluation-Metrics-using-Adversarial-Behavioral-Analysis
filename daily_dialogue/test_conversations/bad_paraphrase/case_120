Is there anything else , apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio ?
There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years .
Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem .
And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year .

And the entire proportion of yield on pluses should not be smaller than the norm , for that fussy diligence , for the first two one-fourths of the yr .
