What kind of place shall we rent ?
It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
