I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me .
What did you argue about ?
He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet .
Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair .
Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .
Did you lend him a lot of money ?
Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?
No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up .
Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?

Of naturally you should . You wouldn ’ t need a dizzy statement to bankrupt a foresightful friendship , would you ?
