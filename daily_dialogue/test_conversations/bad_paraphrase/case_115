The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening .
Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?
Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .
Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?

mayhap we can chance a space to determine some Formosan cookery . I try there 's a station in Chinatown where you can take some trends . Are you concerned ?
