We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival .
When is it ?
It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .
Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?
OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
