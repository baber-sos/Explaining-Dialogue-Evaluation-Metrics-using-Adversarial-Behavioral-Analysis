I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ?
It's simple . You can use call transfer .
Is it so simple ?
Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .
It's true .
Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call .

Call transport has many other advantages . When I am in homes where meshing ca n't continue , such as the gamey edifice , I also expend call transferral mapping , which transplants my yells to the hand - devoid phone and I will not drop any call .
