Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?
Sure ! What do you feel like having ?
I really feel like having a big juicy steak !
Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
I'm not , I am a vegan .
A what ?
A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
