Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?
Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .
That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .

That 's passably easygoing to excuse . With the sediment , the interestingness is limited , but the dividend of each insurance will be transplanted mechanically into your camber story by the remainder of each yr . The longer the terminus , the mellower the dividend you realize . This is because it is accounted at the compound interest pace .
