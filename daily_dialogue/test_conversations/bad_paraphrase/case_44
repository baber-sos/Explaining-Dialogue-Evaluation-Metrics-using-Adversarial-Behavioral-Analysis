Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?
I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .
What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?
Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .
And your parents took it badly ?
That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .
Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?
She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .

She commenced contending back to my pop that how much she bonks her beau , how they 're in passion and it 's not spiting anybody , and so on . My pop read she 's too new to do this , and that she should move out aright forth .
