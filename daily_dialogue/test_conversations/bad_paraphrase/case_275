Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree .
Do we have to ?
Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .
It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .
A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room .
But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down .
But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it .
I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
But it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .

I acknowledge , I screw . But it prompts me of the neat Yule we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the tikes , and the cousins - - the nutrient was serious , and everybody came what they needed .
