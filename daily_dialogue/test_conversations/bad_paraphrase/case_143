It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .
Have I got a high fever ?
Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
Yes , I have .
Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '
Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
All right , thanks .
The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
What shall I do today ?
I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .
