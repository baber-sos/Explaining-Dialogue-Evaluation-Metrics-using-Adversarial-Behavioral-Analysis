How are you wedding plans going ?
Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress .
When will that be ready ?
The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .
You ’ re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ’ Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .
Yes . We ’ Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
The palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job .
Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .

yes . It will be expensive , but we reckon it will be deserving it . It generates us groovy heartsease of intellect to experience that our receipt is in the handwritings of experient masseses .
