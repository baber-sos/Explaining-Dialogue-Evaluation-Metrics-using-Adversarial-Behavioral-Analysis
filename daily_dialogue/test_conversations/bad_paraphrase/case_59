Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?
We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .
You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .
OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ?
I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .

I intend the only affair is toner . stress to see if they can have it before the remainder of clientele daylight tomorrow . We should really prove to do safer about waiting until the last arcminute to sate guilds that are unremarkably made on a monthly footing . Anyhow , see what you can do to hasten the guild this clip .
