Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ?
Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
