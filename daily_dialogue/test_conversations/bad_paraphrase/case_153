I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me .
What did you argue about ?
He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet .
Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair .
Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .
