Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK .
Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious .
I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .
I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation .
It must have really hurt afterwards .
Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .
