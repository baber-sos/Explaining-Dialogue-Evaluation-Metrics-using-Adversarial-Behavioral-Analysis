Next , please . May I help you , sir ?
Hello , yes , I ’ d like to open a bank account .
Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ?
What What features do they offer ?
Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars .
I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money .
Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that .
