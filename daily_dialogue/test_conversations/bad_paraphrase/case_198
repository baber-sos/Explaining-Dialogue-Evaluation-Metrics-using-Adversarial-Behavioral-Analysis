I am calling to find out why I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week .
Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period ?
I think I forgot to send it in !
You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid .
Can I send it in now ?
You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ’ t been , we will still accept it .
Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ’ t late ?

Can I send it in former next sentence so it ISN ’ t recently ?
