Why don't you watch where you're going ?
Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .
