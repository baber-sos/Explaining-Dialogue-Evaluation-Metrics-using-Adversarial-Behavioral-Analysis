How are the children doing at sport ?
I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age .
He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age .
Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?

Two ms ? That implies that the eminent parachuting barroom is above his psyche ! Are any of them honest at long - length run ?
