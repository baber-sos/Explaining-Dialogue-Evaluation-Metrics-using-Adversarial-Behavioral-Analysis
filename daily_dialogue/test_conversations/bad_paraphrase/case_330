What game do you like ?
I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .
I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated .
It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .
I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?
