Shall we share a taxi ?
Where are you heading now ?
I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house .
Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?
That's the one .
You mean we'll share the taxi ?
Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully .
