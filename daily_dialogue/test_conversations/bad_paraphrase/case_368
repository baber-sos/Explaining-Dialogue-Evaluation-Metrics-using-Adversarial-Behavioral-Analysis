I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ?
Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?
I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .
You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ?
You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film .
It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress .
