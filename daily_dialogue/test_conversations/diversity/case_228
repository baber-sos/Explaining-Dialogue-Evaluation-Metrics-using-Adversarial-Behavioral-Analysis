Hello, this is Mike, Kara .
Mike! Good to hear from you . How are you?
Everything is fine, and how are you?
Things are going well with me .
Kara, I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday .
Mike, I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home.
