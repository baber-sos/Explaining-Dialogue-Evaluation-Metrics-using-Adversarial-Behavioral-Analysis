Can we choose a time to look at houses together?
Can you do that in the mornings, or would the afternoons be best?
Either way is good for me .
There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you?
I can take a little time off of work, or I can go on a weekend, also .
We could meet at the real estate office, or I could pick you up at your home .
I am leaving from work, so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .
I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day.
