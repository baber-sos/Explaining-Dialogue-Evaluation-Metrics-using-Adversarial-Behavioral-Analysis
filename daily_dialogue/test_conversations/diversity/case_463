How many cleaning ladies does your company hire?
We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education .
Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .
But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things.
