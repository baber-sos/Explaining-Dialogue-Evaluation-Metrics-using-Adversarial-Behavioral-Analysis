Our toner cartridges are already out of ink...Could you make an order for a new set?
We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers? That will be a large order, probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .
You can double check with the housekeeping department, but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier, the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance, they can usually fill the order .
OK, I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it?
