So, Monica, how do you like your new office?
Well, I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially, I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place!
That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful.
