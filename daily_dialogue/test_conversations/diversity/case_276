Hello Mr Waterstone, what can I do for you today?
Hello, Becky . Well, you see, I have this thing here, called a Fixed Deposit Certificate, and I've just noticed the date on it .
Oh, I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew .
I think I'll redeem, if that's not a problem .
No problem at all, Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money?
Anything you like, but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes .
Here we go, Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note.
