... so, I said, let ’ s take a break.And since that night, I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call, but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else, do you?
Come on, don ’ t be so dramatic! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine .
You think so? Oh, no! How can he do this to me? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me! Why else wouldn ’ t he call?
But, you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .
He ’ s the love of my life! I ’ Ve really messed this up .
Come on, hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright .
But I...I still love him! And it ’ s all my fault! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean, he is a firefighter, it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up!
