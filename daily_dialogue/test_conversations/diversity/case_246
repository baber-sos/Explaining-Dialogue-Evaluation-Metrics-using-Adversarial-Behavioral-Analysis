I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you, we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this .
