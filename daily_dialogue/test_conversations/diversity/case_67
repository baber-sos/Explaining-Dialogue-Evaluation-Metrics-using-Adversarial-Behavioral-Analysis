Do you know Chinese better now?
Oh, definitely . I remember, when I first arrived in Guangzhou, my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .
Oh, yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
I mean, I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
A shouting match? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it .
I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
