Well, tell me something of yourself .
What would you like to know, Mr . Green?
What working experience have you get?
In 2004, I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later, I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since, which is just over a year now .
Oh, good . Irene, can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant? Don't you like your present job?
