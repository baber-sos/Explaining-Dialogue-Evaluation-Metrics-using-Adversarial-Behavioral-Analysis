Well, Mitzuko-san, I hope you like it here . This is my favourite restaurant in Taipei . It reminds me of my youth when I traveled around Europe .
It looks wonderful . Very authentic .
The chef trained in Florence . The pasta is very good here .
OK . So, what can you recommend?
Hum...You should try the mushroom fettucine . It's really good .
Is it salty?
Not at all . It has a very delicate flavor .
What does' Duppa del Giono' mean? I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce that.
