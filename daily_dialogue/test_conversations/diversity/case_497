Hey Suzie . Guess what? I'm having a baby!
Really? That's so great . Congratulations .
Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .
That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant?
Three months .
Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl?
I want to, but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .
Maybe it's more exciting not knowing .
I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .
There are so many things you have to prepare for .
I know I am going to be busy, but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time.
