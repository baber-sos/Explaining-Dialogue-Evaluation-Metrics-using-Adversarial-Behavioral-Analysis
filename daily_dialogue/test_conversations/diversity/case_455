Steven, shall we go shopping tomorrow?
Hum...Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping .
But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don ’ t mind, that's OK .
Hum.Maybe it will be better . The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work .
I see . We will go the day after tomorrow.
