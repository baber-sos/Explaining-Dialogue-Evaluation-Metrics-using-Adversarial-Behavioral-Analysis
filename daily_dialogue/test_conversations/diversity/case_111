what was your wedding ceremony like, Abigail?
my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .
three parties? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive!
well, since my husband and I are from two different countries, and we live in a third country, we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive .
were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married?
I would have liked them to be there, but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us, and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them, so they understood.
