Dave, there's something I want to talk to you about .
Zina, why are you whispering?
I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship .
What? Are you serious? You'd defect to our archrival!?
Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .
We definitely have to talk, Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose.
