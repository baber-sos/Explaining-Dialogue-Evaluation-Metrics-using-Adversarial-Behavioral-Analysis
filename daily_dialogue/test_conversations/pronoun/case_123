Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?
Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English .
I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?
Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .
It must be interesting to study English .
Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
