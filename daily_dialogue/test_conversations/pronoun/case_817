Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ?
It was funny .
Tell me about it , will you ?
Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight .
Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?
Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .
You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?
We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .
