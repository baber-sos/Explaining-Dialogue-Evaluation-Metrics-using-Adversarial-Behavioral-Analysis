Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . It says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months !
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ?
Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !
Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists .
Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
