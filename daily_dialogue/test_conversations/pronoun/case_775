How can I help you ?
Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith .
Do you have an appointment ?
Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .
I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ?
Sure .
Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
That would be very nice . Thank you .
