What do you think of this one ?
Eh , so so .
And this one ? Too flashy ?
Nah , not too flashy .
Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ?
I guess .
Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .
And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !
Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first !
Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
