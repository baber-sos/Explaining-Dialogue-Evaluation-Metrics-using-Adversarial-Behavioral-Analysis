Excuse me , I have something to trouble you .
Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you .
An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist .
Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?
I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?
Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .
It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
