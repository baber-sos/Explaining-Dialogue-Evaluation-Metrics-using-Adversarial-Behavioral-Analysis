my lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place .
I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
Do you know any places ?
well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
anything you need to have in the place ?
I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
you can also check out university bulletin boards .
why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?
not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
