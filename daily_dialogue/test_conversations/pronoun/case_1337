Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ?
There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers .
Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa .
Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food .
