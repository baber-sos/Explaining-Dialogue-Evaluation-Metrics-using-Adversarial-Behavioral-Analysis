The plumbing in my new apartment is not working .
I need you to tell me what the problem is .
The bathroom sink is stopped up .
Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ?
Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
