Wow ! Your fruit looks really fresh ! How much are these apples ?
The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ?
Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ?
They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship .
Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !
Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !
They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?
