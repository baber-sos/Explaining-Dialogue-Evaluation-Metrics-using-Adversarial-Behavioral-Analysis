Good afternoon . Can I be of service ?
I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ?
Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available .
Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB .
OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ?
Here you go . By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ?
No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them .
