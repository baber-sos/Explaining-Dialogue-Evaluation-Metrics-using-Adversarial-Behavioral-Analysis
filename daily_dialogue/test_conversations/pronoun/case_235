OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing .
You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul .
Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !
Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
