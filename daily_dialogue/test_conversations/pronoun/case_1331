Isn't it wonderful walking here ?
What do you mean ?
I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .
It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .
What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?
