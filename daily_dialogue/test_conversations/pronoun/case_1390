Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
Sorry , I thought you knew .
But you should tell me you were in love with her .
Didn't I ?
You know you didn't .
Well , I am telling you now .
Yes , but you might have told me before .
I didn't think you would be interested .
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
