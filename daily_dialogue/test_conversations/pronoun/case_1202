Did you already take the history exam ?
Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ?
I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?
Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society .
What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?
I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .
Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
