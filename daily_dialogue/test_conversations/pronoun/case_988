how long will it take us to drive to London ?
I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway .
that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours .
you ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas .
so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
ok . You haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ?
no . let me take a look ... it ’ s longer than my car .
I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
