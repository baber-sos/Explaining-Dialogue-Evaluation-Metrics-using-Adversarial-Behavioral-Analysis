guess what ? I've got great news !
what is it ?
well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?
yes .
well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .
really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?
she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .
wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?
it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .
are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?
yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !
do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?
I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .
I'm really looking forward to reading your column .
