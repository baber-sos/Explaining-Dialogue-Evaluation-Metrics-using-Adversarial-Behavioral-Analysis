What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days .
Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high .
And what's the cause of that ?
Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down .
But I can't just slow down .
You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size .
