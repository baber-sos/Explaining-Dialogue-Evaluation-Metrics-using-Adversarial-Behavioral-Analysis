I hear you are planning to travel abroad .
Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ?
In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .
Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii .
Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight .
