What can I do for you today ?
I would like to use a computer .
Do you have your library card ?
I sure do .
There is a wait for the computers .
That ’ s all right .
You need to print your name on this list .
Okay . Now what ?
Once a computer is available , I will let you know .
How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?
All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
That ’ s it ? Thank you very much .
