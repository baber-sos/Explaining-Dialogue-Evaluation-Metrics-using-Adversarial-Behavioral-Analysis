Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ?
I think the supermarket is closed now .
Oh , When does it close ?
It closes at 7:00 on Sundays .
That's too bad .
Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 .
Alright . What do you want to do now ?
Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner .
Where does she live ?
She lives in San Francisco .
How long has she lived there ?
I think she's lived there for about 10 years .
That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?
