I think Yoga might be suitable for me .
Why ?
Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .
I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .
