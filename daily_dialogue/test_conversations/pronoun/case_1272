What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
