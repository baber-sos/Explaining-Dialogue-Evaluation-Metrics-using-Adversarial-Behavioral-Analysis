I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season .
That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
