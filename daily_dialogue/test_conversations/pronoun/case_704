Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ?
I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service .
This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies .
What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ?
Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries .
