This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee .
If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .
What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .
I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?
What's your proposal ?
Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway .
Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !
What would you suggest ?
