Excuse me , could you help me pick out a lotion ?
Sure , what is the problem ?
I got poison oak while hiking , and I need something to help me with the itching .
I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream .
Which do you prefer ?
Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .
Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ?
You can take an antihistamine .
Thank you so much for all of the information .
