Hi , I'm George . I'll be your waiter this evening . Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ?
I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
Can I get you anything to drink ? :
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
