Unfortunately , according to our regulations I have to confiscate these counterfeit notes .
So , this 500 RIB is worthless ?
I'm sorry but it is our regulation , so I must follow it . We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . Then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so .
Right , I see . Let me give you another 500 RIB .
Here's your Passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 RIB worth of counterfeit notes .
Thanks . Now can I make the full deposit ?
Yes . Please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue .
