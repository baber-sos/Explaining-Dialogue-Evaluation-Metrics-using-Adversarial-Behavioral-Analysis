Come on , you are left behind !
Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .
You just need more exercise .
Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !
I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .
But running so fast is not good for people over forties .
Why ?
We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .
But I want to burn up more calories !
In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .
