Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .
I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .
Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .
