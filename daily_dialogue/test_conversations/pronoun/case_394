Could you please tell me how I can go job-hunting in the web ?
Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements .
How should I contact them ?
You can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database .
Can I get a quick reply from the sites ?
Yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while .
