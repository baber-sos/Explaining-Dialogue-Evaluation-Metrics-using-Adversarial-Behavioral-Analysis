Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby !
Really ? That's so great . Congratulations .
Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .
That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?
Three months .
Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?
I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .
Maybe it's more exciting not knowing .
I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .
There are so many things you have to prepare for .
