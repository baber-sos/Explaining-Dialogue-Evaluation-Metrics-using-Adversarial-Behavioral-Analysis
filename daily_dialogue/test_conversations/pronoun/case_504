Our benefits usually include medical insurance , public accumulation fund and allowances .
What are the allowances ?
If you go on a business trip , you will enjoy the allowance . It is 200 yuan per day .
Well , I see . And what about the vacation in our company ?
As a new-comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . And remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave .
