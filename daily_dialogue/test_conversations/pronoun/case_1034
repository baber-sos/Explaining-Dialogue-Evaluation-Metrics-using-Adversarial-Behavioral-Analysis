Hey honey , how was your day ?
It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while . He ’ s in a bit of a jam .
Why ? What happened ?
Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s .
Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too .
Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
