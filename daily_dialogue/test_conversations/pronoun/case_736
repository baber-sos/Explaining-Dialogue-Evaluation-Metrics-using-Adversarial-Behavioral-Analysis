Hello Mr Waterstone , what can I do for you today ?
Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it .
Oh , I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew .
I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem .
No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?
