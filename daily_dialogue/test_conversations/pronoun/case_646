Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !
What is it ? What happened ?
I think someone is stalking me .
No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
What did you do ?
I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
