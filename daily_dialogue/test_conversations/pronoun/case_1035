Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?
Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content .
Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?
Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .
