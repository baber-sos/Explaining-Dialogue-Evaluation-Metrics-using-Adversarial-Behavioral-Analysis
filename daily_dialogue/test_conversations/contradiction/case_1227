Where are you going , Jane ?
I'm going to the hospital to see Susan .
I saw her yesterday.She was a little better .
Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
