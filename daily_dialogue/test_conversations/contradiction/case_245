Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ?
Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .
That doesn't sound too bad .
Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .
Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot .
You're welcome .
