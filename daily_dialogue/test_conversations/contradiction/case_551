did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?
no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .
yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .
they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
