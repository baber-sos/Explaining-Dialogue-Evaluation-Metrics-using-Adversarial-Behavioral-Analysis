Hello , I'd like to reserve a hotel room .
That should be no problem . May I have your full name , please ?
My name is John Sandals .
Hello , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days do you need that reservation , sir ?
I'm planning to visit New York from Friday , April 14 until Monday , April 17 .
Our room rates recently went up . Is that okay with you , Mr . Sandals ?
How much per night are we talking about ?
Each night will be $ 308 .
That price is perfectly acceptable .
Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
Nonsmoking , please .
Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ?
That sounds fine .
Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number .
Certainly . My phone number is 626-555-1739 .
