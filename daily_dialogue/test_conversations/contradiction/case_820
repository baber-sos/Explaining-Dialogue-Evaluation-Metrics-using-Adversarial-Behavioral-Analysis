how are you doing , Christopher ?
to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break !
are you doing anything this weekend ?
I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !
are you available on Sunday ?
yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .
ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?
