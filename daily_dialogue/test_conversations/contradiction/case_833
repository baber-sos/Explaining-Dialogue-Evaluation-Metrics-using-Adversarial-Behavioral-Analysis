Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ?
Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it .
I think I can handle it by myself .
I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
