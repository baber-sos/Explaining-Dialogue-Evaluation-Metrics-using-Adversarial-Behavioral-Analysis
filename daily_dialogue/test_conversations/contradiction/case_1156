They don't really think you took it , do they ?
I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life .
How many of them were there ?
Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions .
Like what ?
Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that .
What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ?
I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning .
