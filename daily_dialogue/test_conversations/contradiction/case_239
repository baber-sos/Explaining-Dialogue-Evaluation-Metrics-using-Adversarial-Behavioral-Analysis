Are you interested in history ?
Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks .
I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !
Some people say that history repeats itself .
What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?
