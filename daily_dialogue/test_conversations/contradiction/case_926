Hi Jim . Do you have a minute ?
Sure , what ’ s up ?
Some of us are going to start a soccer team . Would you like to join us ?
I don ’ t know anything about it . Soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here .
That ’ s all right . We ’ ll teach you .
Is it anything like American football ?
Not very much . It ’ s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
I ’ ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ’ s like .
Good idea . I think you ’ ll like it if you give it a chance .
