This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing !
It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip .
Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke !
I get too tired ! I ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier !
Try kicking your legs more . That ’ s good . Don ’ t go out too far !
It ’ s fine . Jump in !
Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark !
