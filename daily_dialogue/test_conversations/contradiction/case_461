Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this .
Tell me what seems to be the problem .
My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep .
