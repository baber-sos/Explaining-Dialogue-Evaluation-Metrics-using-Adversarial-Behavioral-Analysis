did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?
why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .

do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?
no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
