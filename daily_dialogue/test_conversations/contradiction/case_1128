What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .
Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .
Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?
He asked me how long it took me to learn English .
But , you were born and raised in California !
Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
