You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ?
Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful .
So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?
Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .
Do you do the same exercises every day ?
No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .
Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?
It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .
