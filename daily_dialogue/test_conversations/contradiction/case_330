Hi , Jack , how have you been ?
Not very well .
Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?
Nothing .
Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .
Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .
Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .
Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .
Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .
Maybe you're right .
Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !
