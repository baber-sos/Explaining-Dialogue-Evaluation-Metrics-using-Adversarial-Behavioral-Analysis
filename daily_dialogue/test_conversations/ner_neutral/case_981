hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came .
of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .
yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?
oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn
yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better
