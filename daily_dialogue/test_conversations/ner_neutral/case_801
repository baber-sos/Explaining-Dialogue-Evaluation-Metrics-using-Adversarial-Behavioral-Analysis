I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second .
That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics .
I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ?
I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones .
What do you think our chance are in other events .
In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events .
