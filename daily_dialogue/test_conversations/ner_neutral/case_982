Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .
You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain .
Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .
You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .
No wonder people say
Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !
I didn't know you liked bird-watching .
I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it .
