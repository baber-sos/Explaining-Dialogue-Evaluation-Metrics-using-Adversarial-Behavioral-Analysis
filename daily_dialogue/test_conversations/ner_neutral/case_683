What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps .
I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .
Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ?
He is really outrageous .
What happened ?
I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me .
What ? He can't do this to you .
Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .
What did you do ?
I shouted it back of course .
Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ?
What would you do if you were in my shoes ?
Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .
