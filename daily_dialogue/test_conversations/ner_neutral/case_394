Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny !
Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success .

Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them .
Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once !
Um , Holly ? Look behind you . They're coming this way .
