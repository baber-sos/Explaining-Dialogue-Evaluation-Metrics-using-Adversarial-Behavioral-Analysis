Good morning , Passport , please .
Here you are .
Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection .
Ok.But is there anything wrong ?
It's just a regular inspection . Do you have anything to declare ?
I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift .
Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one .
