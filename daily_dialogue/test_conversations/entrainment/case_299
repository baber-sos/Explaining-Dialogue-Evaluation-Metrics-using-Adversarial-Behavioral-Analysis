I need help using the washer and dryer .
Tell me what the problem is .
I can't figure out how to turn them on .
Do you have some quarters ?
I didn't know I needed change .
The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
Where do I put the change ?
The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
Is that everything that I have to do ?
That's all there is .
I appreciate you helping me with this .
If you need anything else , just let me know .
