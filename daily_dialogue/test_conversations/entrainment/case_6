How do you spend your day , Helen ?
Well , on weekdays I get up around ten . Then I read the paper for an hour and have lunch at about noon .
Really ? What time do you go to work ?
I start work at three .
And when do you get home at night ?
I get home pretty late , around midnight .
So what do you do , exactly ?
I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT !
Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV .
