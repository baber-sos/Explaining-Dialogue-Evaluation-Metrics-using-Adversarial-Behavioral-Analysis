Hi , Becky , what's up ?
Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
What's the problem ?
She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .
For example ?
Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
