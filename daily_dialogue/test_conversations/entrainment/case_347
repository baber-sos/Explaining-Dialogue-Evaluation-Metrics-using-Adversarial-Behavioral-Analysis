Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city .
OK , please .
My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?
I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants .
Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ?
How old are your children ?
