Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ?
I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really .
Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?
I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
