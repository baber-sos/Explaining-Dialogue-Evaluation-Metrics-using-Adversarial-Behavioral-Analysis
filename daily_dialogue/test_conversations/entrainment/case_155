Do you want to hang out tomorrow ?
Oh , I can't . I have a date !
Really ? Wow with who ?
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend .
Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
