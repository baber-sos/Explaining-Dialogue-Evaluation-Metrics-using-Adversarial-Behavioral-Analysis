Hi , Becky , what's up ?
Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
What's the problem ?
She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .
For example ?
Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
