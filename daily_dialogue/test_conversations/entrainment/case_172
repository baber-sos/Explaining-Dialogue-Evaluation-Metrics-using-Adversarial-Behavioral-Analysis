Hello , Jack . I'm John .
I'm glad to see you !
Sit down , please . Maybe you have read the contract , but I want to give you the details again before you sign the contract . You must have a three-month internship .
Yes , I know .
When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift .
Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ?
