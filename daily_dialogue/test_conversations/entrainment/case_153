You're not looking happy . What's the matter ?
Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .
With the job ?
With everything , with everybody , with all this !
A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .
It wasn't always like this , you know .
What do you mean ?
Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .
