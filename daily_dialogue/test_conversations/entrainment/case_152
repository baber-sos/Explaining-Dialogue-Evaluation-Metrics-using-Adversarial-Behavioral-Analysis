Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?
That's because Americans love sitcoms .
Sitcoms ?
Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .
In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
