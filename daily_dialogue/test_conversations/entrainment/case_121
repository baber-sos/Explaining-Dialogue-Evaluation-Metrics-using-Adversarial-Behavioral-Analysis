Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?
Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...
Is everything ready now ?
Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
