I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ?
It's simple . You can use call transfer .
Is it so simple ?
Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .
