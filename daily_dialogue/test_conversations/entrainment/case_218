Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?
I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .
What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?
Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .
And your parents took it badly ?
