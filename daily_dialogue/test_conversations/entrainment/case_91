what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?
my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .
three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !
well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive .
were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
