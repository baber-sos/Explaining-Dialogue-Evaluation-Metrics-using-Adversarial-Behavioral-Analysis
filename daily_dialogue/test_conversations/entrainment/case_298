Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
Totally agree . What is your solution ?
Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
