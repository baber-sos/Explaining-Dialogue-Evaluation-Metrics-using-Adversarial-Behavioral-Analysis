I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ?
I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel .
You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?
I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .
