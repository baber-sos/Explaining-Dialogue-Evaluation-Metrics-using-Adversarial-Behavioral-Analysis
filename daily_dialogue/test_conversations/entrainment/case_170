have you ever been to Disneyworld ?
when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?
the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .
that's right . Why do you ask ?
well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .
when are you getting married ?
some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .
congratulations ! I had no idea .
thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
do you like amusement parks ?
for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .
if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .
