Hey , what's new ?
Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?
Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me .
What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?
Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .
That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
