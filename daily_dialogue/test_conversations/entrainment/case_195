Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?
Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...
Is everything ready now ?
Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
