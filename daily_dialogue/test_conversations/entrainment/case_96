I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone .
It's ok . What do you want to ask ?
Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?
The first place you should go is the International Center .
Why ?
You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .
What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .
Can we get any more help at the International Center ?
Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office .
