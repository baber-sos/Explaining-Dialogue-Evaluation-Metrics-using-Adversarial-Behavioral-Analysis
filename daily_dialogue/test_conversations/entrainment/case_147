Good afternoon , how may I help you ?
Hi , I'd like to order some flowers .
Who are they for ?
They're for my Wife . Her name is Samantha .
What kind of flowers would you like ?
I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ?
OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ?
Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers .
Do you know what kind of flowers she likes ?
I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now .
Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses .
Roses will be fine .
What color ?
I think red would be nice .
Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ?
Can you deliver them , please ?
