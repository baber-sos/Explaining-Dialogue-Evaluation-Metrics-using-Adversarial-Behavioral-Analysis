Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK .
Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious .
I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .
I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation .
It must have really hurt afterwards .
Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .
I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !
Is there any pain now ?
No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .
